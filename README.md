## Adding a New Feature Article, Photo Essay, or GeoQuiz
1.  Create a new folder under `src/publications/<type>` where `type` is one of `articles`, `photoessays`, or `quizzes`
2.  Create an `img` directory to hold images related to the article
3.  Create an `index.html` file by copying one into your newly created directory from the appropriate `src/templates/<type>` directory
