                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Worldwide the whale watching industry has become big business, generating about US$2 billion in
                    tourism sales each year (Black 2009; The Australian 2010). Nowhere is this more evident than along
                    North America’s Pacific Coast. Here the focus is on the annual migration of gray whales. Hundreds
                    of businesses, employing thousands of people, from Alaska to Baja California capitalize on tourists
                    bent on seeing these gentle giants of the ocean. Likewise, dedicated websites enable enthusiasts to
                    vicariously follow pod activity and monitor changing conditions all along the eastern coast of the
                    Pacific Ocean (see Journey North 2018). </p>
                <p>Gray whales (Eschrichtius Robustus) are not the largest whales in the sea. Nor are they the fastest
                    swimmers or the deepest divers. Instead, there are two main reasons why gray whales stand out.
                    First, they are bottom feeders. Unlike all other whales, gray whales skim along the bottom of the
                    ocean on one side of their body. As evidenced from the scars on their bodies, most gray whales are
                    right sided (Dedina 2000; Swartz 2014). As they scoop up material along the continental shelf, the
                    whales stir up sediments where an abundance of nutrients and proteins have settled. This
                    disturbance is vitally important to the food chain and the health of the ecosystem because it
                    allows other sea-dwelling creatures to consume the smorgasbord of free-floating food.</p>
                <p>Second, gray whales are noteworthy because of their annual migration. Each year gray whales make a
                    round trip journey that covers more than 20,000 kilometers (12,500 miles). Scholars assert that the
                    gray whales’ annual trek is among the longest of any mammal on Earth (Dedina 2000; WDC 2018).
                    Because they are bottom feeders, gray whales prefer to stay within two to three miles of the shore
                    as they migrate. This makes them particularly popular among tourists because day-trippers can take
                    small boats out to gaze at the whales while maintaining a safe distance from shore. When gray
                    whales feel comfortable and not threatened, they exhibit a generally inquisitive, friendly, and
                    playful demeanor (Friedlander 2010). This adds to their tourism appeal.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this article is to highlight the growth of the whale watching industry in the lagoons
                    of central Baja California, Mexico. Each year thousands of tourists descend upon these remote,
                    isolated bodies of water to engage in an unparalleled experience. This article illustrates that not
                    only does the whale watching industry fulfill the interests of international tourists, but it has
                    been instrumental in the preservation of the local environment and the diversification of the local
                    economy. Our paper focuses on the lagoons of central Baja California, Mexico where the whales breed
                    and give birth. We begin with an overview of the gray whale’s annual migration, followed by a
                    discussion of historical human-whale interactions in the eastern Pacific. Next, we present the rise
                    of whale watching tourism in Laguna San Ignacio. Finally we highlight how the local environment and
                    economy have benefitted from whale watching tourism.</p>

                <p>Physiologically, adult gray whales are ideally shaped for long distance migration (WDC 2018).
                    Despite being as much as 15 meters (50 feet) long and weighing up to 40,000 kilograms (45 tons),
                    gray whales have long sleek bodies and a tapered head that is pointed at the tip; a shape that
                    closely resembles a submarine (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). Their powerful fluke (tail)
                    enables the whales to easily
                    cut through the water at speeds of 8 to 10 kilometers per hour (5 to 7 miles per hour). The average
                    adult is covered by as much as 25 cm (10 inches) of blubber (body fat) that not only keeps them
                    warm, but adds buoyancy and provides a constant source of hydration.</p>
                <p>Each autumn the eastern gray whales begin their annual migration from their feeding waters in the
                    Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. Beginning in mid-October as ice begins to form, pregnant
                    mothers lead the trek south. They are followed by juvenile and adolescent males and by December the
                    older males bring up the rear of the migration.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="3" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp1" title="The Gray Whales’ Annual Migration (2)">
                <div id="figure2" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/fig2.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption"><a class="location" data-layer-id="fig2">Figure 2</a>: Laguna San Ignacio. Photo
                    by Jeffrey S. Smith</div>
                <p>From December to April the majority of the gray whales spend their time in the bays along the coast
                    of Baja California, Mexico. Three main lagoons are particularly appealing to the gray whales. In
                    the south, Magdalena Bay is the largest and attracts nearly 2,000 whales each year while farther
                    north, Laguna Ojo de Liebre hosts about 1,000 whales. The smallest is Laguna San Ignacio (8
                    kilometers wide by 26 kilometers long -- 5 miles wide by 16 miles long) where about 300 gray whales
                    spend the winter (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
                <p>For most of the winter the three lagoons see a frenzy of activity as the younger males seek out
                    mating partners while the mothers give birth and nurse their young. The younger males are the most
                    restless and they tend to visit all three bodies of water. Some tour guides suggest that the young
                    males’ behavior is akin to the practice of bar hopping or pub popular among post-adolescent humans.
                    Overall, however, the males of all ages spend less time in the bays than females.</p>
                <p>Over generations, pregnant cows have found these three bays to be ideal nurseries for five
                    geographic reasons. First, because of their natural configuration, the water in the bays is
                    protected from severe storms thus safe for giving birth and raising young. Second, because the
                    depth of the water in the bays is relatively shallow, the water tends to be warmer than the open
                    ocean. Third, all three lagoons are remnant playas (Gill 1998) with limited freshwater recharge.
                    Given the high evaporation rates in Baja California, the water is also higher in salt content.
                    Therefore, when the babies are born without any blubber (just bone and underdeveloped muscle mass)
                    the extra salty, warm water helps keep them afloat (Dedina 2000; Swartz 2014). Fourth, in the
                    depths of the wide open ocean orcas are incredibly efficient hunters using a variety of techniques
                    (PBS 2014). One approach is to attack their prey from below by ramming the victim at full speed.
                    However, because the bays are relatively shallow orcas have a more difficult time attacking the
                    whales and their young. Thus, the bays are relatively safe from their prime natural predator.
                    Finally, the mothers use the changing tidal flows within the bays to train and strengthen the baby
                    whales’ muscles. Throughout the day, cows and their calves swim against the tide as if they were on
                    a treadmill. Over the course of four months each baby’s swimming muscles grow stronger and their
                    lung capacity expands; ingredients needed for the long trek north.</p>
                <p>In March the older males, followed by the younger males head back to the Arctic Ocean. By early-May
                    the mothers and their babies are on their way north. The average life expectancy of a gray whale is
                    60 years. Over the course of their lifetime, gray whales migrate approximately 1.2 million
                    kilometers (750,000 miles) which is equivalent to traveling from the Earth to the Moon, back to the
                    Earth and back to the Moon (WDC 2018).</p>

                <h3>A History of Human-Whale Interaction along the Eastern Pacific</h3>
                <p>Prior to the mid-1800s, whale hunting activity was incredibly dangerous, dependent on small boats
                    and primitive weapons including crude pointed spears and hand-held knives (Ellis 1991). Many
                    hunters died in the process and whales became known as dangerous creatures. Commercial whaling,
                    started by the Dutch in the sixteenth century, accelerated in the mid-nineteenth century with
                    advances in whaling technology. The introduction of large steamships afforded hunters greater
                    safety against the behemoths of the sea while the new explosive harpoons eliminated hand-to-whale
                    combat. More recent technological advances include air compressors and radar equipment.</p>
                <p>In 1850 there were about 900 whaling ships worldwide and U.S. business interests owned more than 80%
                    of them. By the late 1800s, American on-land whale factories were processing hundreds of whales
                    each month. The U.S. whaling industry ranked fifth among all the sectors of the U.S. economy and
                    generated about $10 million dollars and y (Economist 2015). Although port facilities along the
                    Atlantic coast were home to some operations, the majority of U.S. whaling occurred along the
                    Pacific coast. Whale oil is derived from the triglycerides that make up a large part of a whale’s
                    blubber. Today, we associate triglycerides with bad cholesterol and something to avoid, but at the
                    turn of the nineteenth century triglycerides were highly coveted. One account wonders which
                    California Rush generated more revenue in the 1850s: gold or whale oil (Economist 2015).</p>
                <p>Modern human-whale encounters in the lagoons of Baja California began in the mid-1800s when American
                    whaler Charles Melville Scammon discovered the three bays almost by accident. According to oral
                    tradition, for as long as local residents could remember, whales of all sizes would show up and
                    spend the winter in the protected waters of the three lagoons. After hearing about this, in 1857
                    Captain Scammon went to investigate. He first entered the bay, later dubbed Scammon’s Lagoon (and
                    later yet renamed Ojo de Liebre Bay), and found the hunting fairly acceptable. While talking with
                    local fishermen, he learned that whaling operations would probably be more fruitful in the smaller,
                    more confined waters of Laguna San Ignacio. There, mothers and their calves were easier to find. In
                    1860 he returned to San Ignacio Bay with six ships and found the whaling conditions ideal. He
                    harpooned four dozen cows and filled hundreds of barrels of oil (Henderson 1972).</p>
                <p>Ironically, while Scammon and his men were killing the whales the captain was consumed with studying
                    them. As a self-trained naturalist, he collected a wide variety of data on the whales and in 1874
                    he published a book titled “The Marine Mammals of the North-western Coast of North America.” At the
                    time it was a financial flop, but today the same book is considered a seminal read for anyone
                    interested in mammals of the eastern Pacific (Swartz 2014).</p>
                <p>Because of Scammon’s tremendous success, whaling operations in the three lagoons expanded
                    dramatically. Whalers from throughout the Pacific region descended upon the three lagoons and
                    within a few years San Ignacio Bay was void of whales (Henderson 1972). In Scammon’s Lagoon the
                    hunting was so intense that locals began referring to the bay by a new name: Ojo de Liebre (Spanish
                    for: “The Eye of the Hare”). So many whales were being slaughtered in that lagoon that the water
                    turned bright red just like a jack rabbit’s eye. Whaling operations decimated the eastern gray
                    whale population and by the 1930s there were less than a thousand gray whales left in the Pacific.
                    It was clear to local fishermen that fewer whales were returning to the lagoons each winter.</p>
                <p>During this era gray whales became incredibly feared. In his book, Scammon called them “the monsters
                    of the deep.” Unlike the bowhead and right whales who succumbed without a fight, the gray whales
                    were ferocious fighters. When assaulted, the gray whales (especially mothers) would attack the
                    boat; many whalers were injured, maimed, and even killed. Because of this the gray whale was
                    nicknamed “the Devil Fish” (Swartz 2014).</p>
                <p>At its peak (late 1800s) whale oil commanded a price of $2.50 a gallon (Economist 2015). The demand
                    for whale oil diminished with the advent of kerosene for heating and light and the use of vegetable
                    oils for cooking. As demand fell, the price of whale oil dropped to $.40 a gallon which saved many
                    whale species from imminent extinction (Dedina 2000; Economist 2015).</p>
                <p>Following World War II there was a rebound in whaling operations as a number of European countries
                    (especially Germany) and Japan were left destitute after the war. As an alternative to expensive
                    kerosene, these countries went back to using whale oil for heating and lighting and whale meat for
                    food. By the 1940s the International Whaling Commission (IWC) realized that the world’s whale
                    population was quickly being annihilated. In 1946 the IWC established a minimum size and country
                    quota for whaling operations (IWC 2018).</p>
                <p>The peak of modern whaling occurred in the 1960s when about 35,000 whales each year were harvested.
                    Baleen whales (e.g. blue, gray, and humpback) were the most hunted because they were slower and
                    contained more blubber than the typical toothed whales. Some of the largest whales could generate
                    up to $3,000 in profits (Swartz 2014). Plus, baleen whales have tended to be more docile when
                    attacked (in particular, bowhead and right whales would rarely fight back). By the 1970s the
                    world’s whale population was becoming obliterated and many of the great whale species were placed
                    on the endangered species list (Dedina 2000). In 1986 there was an international moratorium on
                    whaling with exceptions granted for research and indigenous rights. By 2016, only 1,400 whales were
                    harvested worldwide and four countries object to the ongoing quota limits: Iceland, Japan, Norway,
                    and Russia (IWC 2018). Today, six of the thirteen great whale species are still on the endangered
                    species list including the blue, gray, and right whales. At current rates of hunting, the northern
                    right whale is on a path to extinction by 2043 (WDC 2018).</p>

                <h3>Rise of Whale Watching in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California, Mexico</h3>
                <p>According to local residents, the first permanent settlement in central Baja California was
                    established in 1910. Over the next seven decades the Mexican government conferred a number of
                    ejidos (lands held and operated by a community of people) in the region. Most were fishing villages
                    where their main source of income was derived from the sea. For as long as people can remember, the
                    three bays have been ideal fishing waters, especially for grouper, sea bass, halibut, and blue crab
                    as well as various clams and oysters. From October to December, the lagoons are also prime waters
                    for trapping lobster. For decades, most of the catch has been exported to the United States
                    (especially California) and China.</p>
                <p>Francisco “Pachico” Mayoral is reported to be the first person to pet a gray whale. As a lifelong,
                    local fisherman, Pachico knew the waters of Laguna San Ignacio better than most. In 1972 a friend
                    and business associate from southern California flew down to pay him a visit. As the two friends
                    toured the bay, a gray whale cow and her calf started approaching their boat. Remembering all the
                    stories of the vicious whale attacks, Pachico became concerned and started banging on the side of
                    the boat. The friend told him to stop making noise and see what happened. As the story goes, the
                    baby whale and its mother came up to the boat allowing Pachico and his friend to reach over and
                    touch them (Swartz 2014; Short 2016). That event precipitated the local whale watching industry.</p>
                <p>Over the next two years other friends and acquaintances flew down or boated down from southern
                    California to interact with the whales. In 1974, Pachico established the first eco-camp
                    (environmentally friendly camping facility) and the whale watching industry started to grow (Swartz
                    2014; Fischer 2018).</p>
                <p>Even though there are considerably more gray whales that pass the winter in Magdelena and Ojo de
                    Liebre bays, Laguna San Ignacio is considered the best place to whale watch because it is smaller
                    and more confined. Thus, the whales are more concentrated and easier to encounter. The incredibly
                    stable, 7 meter (23 foot) fiberglass pangas (boats) with outboard motors slowly approach the whales
                    when they surface for air (Figure 4). As baby whales (6 to 7.5 meters – 20 to 25 feet long)
                    entertain the human visitors with their antics (Figure 5), mother whales (the size of a standard
                    school bus) use the bottom of the boats as effective back scratchers.</p>
                <p>Today there are a total of seven eco-camps offering varying degrees of comfort; some feature wooden
                    “cabins” (sheds) (Figure 7) while others invite visitors to sleep on cots in tents (Figure 8). All
                    of the camps operate off-the-grid using renewable energy sources (especially wind and solar)
                    (Figure 9). Likewise, they are self-sufficient; all food and water is trucked in from nearby
                    suppliers while waste is either recycled or removed to an inland landfill.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="6" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp1" title="El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve">
                <p>In the mid-1980s word about the prime fishing waters spread and fishermen from other parts of Mexico
                    (especially from the states of Sinaloa and Michoacán) began arriving in droves. The environment in
                    and around Laguna San Ignacio rapidly began to change. As many as 120 boats per day plied the
                    waters of San Ignacio Bay (Fischer 2018). Unlike the local fishermen who limited their catch to
                    mature fish, clams, and oysters, the foreign fishermen scooped up all the seafood they could catch.
                    It was clear to local residents that San Ignacio Bay was being overfished and the fishing industry
                    was no longer sustainable. Evidence of the tremendous amount of seafood removed from the bay is
                    evident on the landscape; there are hundreds of mounds of clam and oyster shells that were
                    discarded after the meat was removed (Figure 10).</p>
                <p>It is against this backdrop that the Mexican government finally acted. Realizing that existing
                    regulations (first established in 1972 and revised in 1980) were ineffective in protecting the
                    local environment, in 1988 Mexico’s President Miguel de la Madrid created Latin America’s largest
                    nature preserve at 2.5 million hectares (6.2 million acres) (Gill 1998; Swartz 2014). El Vizcaíno
                    Biosphere Reserve represents one of Mexico’s most ambitious efforts to protect the unique flora,
                    fauna, and cultural heritage in the area (Figure 11). In 1993, UNESCO declared the nature preserve
                    a World Heritage site affirming the Mexican government’s commitment to maintaining an environment
                    where fishing, resource extraction (especially salt), and whale watching tourism are balanced
                    against environmental protection (UNESCO 2018).</p>
                <p>Ensuring an environment conducive to whales (and hence the whale watching industry) was at the
                    center of the Mexican government’s efforts (Fischer 2018). El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve strictly
                    regulates visitor comportment (Figure 12). There are limits on the total number of people and group
                    size allowed in Laguna San Ignacio (a ranger stands on shore counting the number of people in each
                    boat) and CONANP (Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas – National Commission of Natural
                    Protected Areas) requires each visitor to purchase a daily use permit (ca. US$20 / day) and be
                    accompanied by a government-approved local guide (CONANP 2018). There are explicit restrictions on
                    permitted activities during the breeding and calving season (e.g. no swimming with or chasing the
                    whales, no more than two boats can simultaneously approach a whale).</p>
                <p>Visitors arrive by both automobile and plane. Many tourists fly in from southern California or Los
                    Cabos, Mexico to enjoy a single-day, whale watching trip. Others commit to a multi-day package
                    (usually five days) where they spend around $2,000 to stay in one of the eco-camps (Figure 13). In
                    2015, the owners of three of the more remote eco-camps that specialize in multi-day trips pitched
                    in to upgrade the dirt landing strip so that foreign tourists would be more inclined to visit their
                    camps (Figure 14).</p>
                <p>As of March 2018, between 750 and 800 people live on five ejidos in the immediate area around San
                    Ignacio Lagoon. During the whale watching season (mid-January to early-May) nearly all of the
                    households derive their income directly or indirectly from tourism. For the remaining months of the
                    year residents subsist on fishing-related activities.</p>
                <p>Of particular interest is how the local population regards whale watching tourism versus the fishing
                    industry. As Maldo Fischer (owner of Camp Cortez) explained, one of the most important aspects of
                    the whale watching industry is that it gives the lagoon a chance to rest and recover. During the
                    whale breeding and calving season, the Mexican government permits only two fishing boats to ply the
                    waters at any given time. This could lead to significant financial hardship. However, local
                    residents have fully embraced this regulation because they have an alternative source of income
                    (whale watching tourism). In fact the fishermen have come to appreciate the fact that the fallow
                    period (downtime) gives the lagoon a chance to breathe. During those four months, the fish
                    population is able to rebound. Local fishermen (also working as boat drivers for the whale watching
                    tours) indicate that the fish population has not yet returned to pre-1980 numbers, but the size of
                    their catches has stabilized at sustainable levels.</p>

            <section id="7" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp1" title="Conclusion ">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Like generations before them, thousands of eastern gray whales make the annual, long-distance
                    migration between the icy, nutrient-rich waters of the Arctic Ocean to the warm, protected bays of
                    Baja California, Mexico where they breed and give birth to the next generation of gray whales. In
                    centuries past, humans had an adversarial relationship with the whales, harvesting their meat and
                    blubber for personal profit. As the whale population rapidly decreased, people realized that an
                    important element of the sea was being lost. As an indicator species, the loss of the gray whales
                    portended disaster for life in the eastern Pacific.</p>
                <p>By the 1970s, numerous efforts undertook to protect the habitat gray whales frequented. In Baja
                    California, Mexico, the government set aside Latin America’s largest nature preserve (El Vizcaíno
                    Biosphere Reserve) for a whale sanctuary and to protect the environment from further destruction.
                    In Laguna San Ignacio, local fishermen whose annual catches had steadily decreased embraced
                    tourism, specifically whale watching, as a complement to fishing. Today, during the annual breeding
                    and calving season (mid-January to early-May), residents of the region rely on the whale watching
                    industry as their main source of income. Each year several hundred visitors descend upon the bay to
                    interact with the whales (Figure 15).</p>
                <p>Overall, this arrangement has been a tremendous financial and environmental success. For eight
                    months each year the local fishermen harvest modest catches that are exported to the United States
                    and China and earn them a decent living. During the whale watching season, the vast majority (at
                    least 85%) of the local population switch hats and assume jobs that support the tourism industry.
                    Because of strict federal regulations combined with a local commitment to protect the environment,
                    during those four months the bay’s fish and sea life population is able to rebound. The financial
                    relief that the whale watching industry brings enables local fishermen to engage in a sustainable
                    use of the local environment.</p>
