                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>When Indians think about Africans in India, most likely will think of African students who are
                    pursuing college degrees in the country, or the African actors/dancers who regularly play small
                    roles in Bollywood, India’s Hindi-language film industry. The majority of people likely will not
                    think of the Siddis, who are Indians of African descent who have lived in India for several
                    centuries. The Siddis are descendants of the Bantu populations of East and Central Africa and are
                    also sometimes referred to as Habshis or Abyssinians. It is thought that they were transported to
                    India in several waves starting as early as the 7th century, first by the Arab merchants/traders,
                    and later by the Portuguese and British, starting in the 16th century. Many Siddis likely were
                    brought to India as slaves, but some were also taken as servants, blacksmiths, carpenters, and
                    masons. Some probably arrived as independent merchants/traders, or soldiers in Arab armies. A few
                    Siddis even held high-ranking positions as kings, military commanders, foot soldiers, and
                    administrators in small regions of India between the 14th and 16th centuries. However, most
                    contemporary Siddis likely are the descendants of slaves or domestic servants. Between 40,000 and
                    50,000 Siddis currently live in India. The population resides primarily in five states (Goa,
                    Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana), but the majority (90%) reside in <a
                        class="location" data-layer-id="state-gujarat">Gujarat</a> or
                    <a class="location" data-layer-id="state-karnataka">Karnataka</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Historically, circumstances and discrimination led many Siddis to practice social and self-exclusion
                    by remaining in the forests that they escaped to after they were freed from bondage. Today, some
                    Siddis still live in physical isolation in forests while other Siddis have physically integrated in
                    towns and villages. However, they have all attained socio-cultural integration within the larger
                    Indian society, despite maintaining their physical African traits. In a society where people from
                    lower-caste populations or who have darker complexions are commonly discriminated against, Siddis
                    face significant challenges. They belong to a lower caste, have a darker skin color and have
                    different physical traits. Supported by a small research grant from my university, I embarked on a
                    one-month summer fieldwork trip to the state of Karnataka to better understand Siddi life and to
                    examine the concept of place attachment as described by the Siddi people. During my fieldwork, I was
                    able to stay with several Siddi families and observe their daily lives, which provided valuable
                    insight into the economic and socio-cultural landscapes. In addition, I was able to see the impact
                    geographical distance played in creating these landscapes.

                <p>The British outlawed slavery in the early to mid-1800s, coinciding with the end of the Goa
                    Inquisition. Fearing recapture, many of the Siddis who were residing in port towns along the Western
                    coast of India escaped deep into the forests of the Uttara Kannada District in the state of
                    Karnataka. The coastal <a class="location" data-layer-id="feature-0">town of Murudeshwar</a>, which overlooks the Arabian Sea
                    on one side and the mountainous Western Ghats on the other, was one such gateway into the dense
                    forests of Uttara Kannada District. Today, Murudeshwar primarily depends on fishing and tourism to
                    support its economy. The Murudeshwar Temple complex includes an imposing 10-story Lord Shiva Statue
                    and 20-story gopura (temple entrance) and is the most popular attraction in town.

                    transportation, from the coast into the forests over the Western Ghats Mountains, can be a
                    hair-raising experience. This time-lapse video shows blind curves on wet roads, and the
                    overtaking of vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. Most Siddis live in the Uttar Kannada
                    District, which is part of the Malnad region. Malnad or Malenadu means land of hills and/or land of
                    rain as the area contains the hilly Western Ghats and also receives some of the highest rates of

                <p>My first encounter with the Siddis after my guide picked me up in the <a class="location" data-layer-id="feature-2">town of Yellapur</a> was with a mother and daughter who had come into town to shop for vegetables and other
                    household goods at the weekly market. They were dressed in traditional Indian clothes, and I was
                    surprised by how easily and naturally they mingled with other locals. Although Siddis primarily
                    speak Konkani (local dialect), they spoke Kannada—the official language of the state—fluently. They
                    were surprised to learn that I could also converse in Kannada, after my guide introduced me as a
                    researcher from the United States who had come to Karnataka to learn about the Siddis. Although many
                    Indians might view the Siddi people as being out of place because of their physical African
                    characteristics, I realized at that moment that I might have looked out of place to them. Only a few
                    Siddi families live within and on the outskirts of Yellapur. Most families live in small villages,
                    isolated groups, or individual households in the forests farther away and must travel to the larger
                    towns once a week on specific market days to purchase groceries. </p>

                </div>
                <p>The majority of Siddi men work as farmers or day laborers. Here, men in a Hindu Siddi family are seen
                    tending to their rice paddy fields in Hullaramane. They explained to me
                    that two of the men were brothers, and that they worked these fields together with their sons. They
                    believed that their ancestors had been on the land for approximately 120 years. The family owned the
                    land and were proud of their self-reliance. The family elder spoke fondly of his grandparents and
                    parents who regularly conveyed to him the importance of owning their land and being self-sufficient.
                    Siddi farmers who are Hindu often own their land. Their ancestors may have settled on unoccupied
                    land, or the land may have been acquired from the property owners (usually upper-caste Brahmins) in
                    return for cultivating it. Many Hindu Siddis depend on farming as their primary economic activity
                    and owing farmland is not uncommon. By comparison, the Christian and Muslim Siddis in Karnataka do
                    not own agricultural land to the same extent.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Areca nuts, also known as betel nuts, are a profitable crop that many Siddi farmers grow in addition
                    to rice. These thin, tall, palm trees near Hullaramane bear berries that
                    encapsulate the nuts, which are harvested and used in many Indian traditions. Areca /betel nuts
                    wrapped in a betel leaf are known to be a low-level psychoactive drug that plays an important role
                    in various South and Southeast Asian cultures. It is a common practice in rural communities to chew
                    on the nut-leaf blend, especially among older people. The blend is also a traditional after-meal
                    mouth refresher known as paan that is widely used across India. India is the world’s largest
                    producer of Areca nuts and the state of Karnataka produces two-thirds of it. The Uttar Kannada
                    District is the most productive area in the state, and so cultivation of the Areca nut is a central
                    aspect of Siddi life.

                <p>The Siddis in Karnataka identify as Hindus (40%), Christians (30%), or Muslims (30%). Religious
                    affiliation can often be traced back to the specific experience encountered by each group after
                    escaping from the western port towns and cities. Religion is important to Siddis, but it has never
                    been a source of division among the people. Siddis believe that they are all descendants of the same
                    ancestors, regardless of their religion, and many Siddis are related to each other within a few
                    generations of lineage. Consequently, Siddis from different religions practice mutual respect,
                    maintain a strong sense of community, and shared identity. This unity has become especially
                    important over the last decade in the wake of the ascension to political power of the Hindu
                    nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the religion-based, divisive politics of Prime Minister
                    Narendra Modi. Here, a saffron-colored BJP flag is flown on a small temple near Hullaramane to show support for the BJP government. These flags are ubiquitous in
                    India and represent an ‘in-your-face’ approach to the nationalist Hindu sentiment. Although these
                    flags instill a sense of pride in many Hindus, they could be antagonizing to other religious groups.

                </div>
                <p>Not all Siddi families own large plots of land. This family owned a small plot of land, but they
                    worked for a Brahmin/upper-caste family as their main source of income. Most of the Siddis who
                    adopted Hinduism did so as a result of their indenturement to Brahmin and upper-caste Hindu
                    families. As the Siddis worked, they voluntarily or were forced to adopt the religion of the
                    property owners as their own. Adopting the religion of their property owners, however, did not
                    prevent the Siddis from being discriminated against. Several Hindu Siddi families recalled how,
                    after finishing a meal provided by the upper-caste Hindu family, they had to clean the area that
                    they had sat on while eating. They had to wash the areas with cow dung and water, which is
                    considered to be a cleansing agent in Hindu society. The Siddis considered this practice to be
                    demeaning and believed that it meant that the upper-caste Hindus did not look at them as equals.
                    Although this practice is less common today due the rights that they have attained over the past
                    decade, it was common until recently.</p>

                <p>The Siddis struggled and fought to attain Scheduled Tribe status, which was granted to them in 2003
                    by the Indian government. This change in status meant that many Siddis were eligible to receive
                    certain government benefits that helped to empower and uplift the communities. The last Siddi
                    communities to be granted Scheduled Tribe status obtained that status only recently, in 2019.
                    However, although Siddis have access to more benefits today than in the past, widespread poverty
                    persists. This family near the <a class="location" data-layer-id="feature-6">village of Tavarkatta</a> owns some land
                    around their home that is used for subsistence farming. To make ends meet, some Siddis who work on
                    small patches of land that they do not necessarily own legally also work as day laborers in the
                    surrounding area. Some also travel to larger towns to become seasonal migrant workers.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Because many Siddi farmers live in small, isolated communities, they must often walk for an hour
                    or more to catch a bus into town. Many families described the challenges associated with sending
                    their children to school in town, which involve long walks on rough paths through the forest.
                    These paths were forged over generations by Siddi families that lived in isolation but remained
                    in intermittent contact with the outside world. My guide told me that some Siddi families still
                    lived in isolation, deep in the forest. The Uttar Kannada District (14.6°N 74.7°E), where most
                    of the Siddis live, is located along the Western Ghats Mountains in the Malnad (land of rain)
                    region. The monsoon rains in this region can make the smaller roads and forest paths difficult
                    to traverse. Commonly, the forest paths become impassable and, as a result, self-sufficient
                    Siddi families often remain in the forests to wait out the monsoons.</p>

                    a result, the dropout rates for Siddi children are high. Unfortunately, many Siddi children do not
                    have the resources to continue their education beyond primary or elementary school. These children

                    these men who were busy filling in a gully with mud to stop rainwater from overflowing into the
                    road. The relentless rain, common in this region, did not pose a deterrent to them as they toiled.
                    Most Siddis do not stray far from the homes or villages that they are familiar with. Due to their
                    history, Siddis feel a strong connection to the forests and places they were raised in. The few who
                    venture beyond their homeland in search of jobs face discrimination and struggle. Many Siddis told
                    me during my fieldwork that they felt most comfortable staying within a 50- to 100-km radius of
                    their homes, because the Siddis and non-Siddis in these areas tend to be familiar with one another.
                    However, if a Siddi ventures beyond that radius in search of work in a larger town and city, he/she
                    is often considered to be an outsider or foreigner. Most non-Siddi Indians who live further than 50-
                    to 100-km from the Siddi homelands are not familiar with Siddis or their history. These Indians
                    automatically assume that any person with Black African physical traits is a recent African
                    immigrant. It has been well documented that African immigrants, primarily students who have come to
                    India to pursue college education, face extreme discrimination. African immigrants in India are
                    commonly stereotyped as drug dealers, gang members, commercial sex workers, or members of other
                    nefarious trades. Thus, societal challenges prevent most Siddis from comfortably venturing beyond a
                    certain distance from their homeland. </p>

                    program was cut after a few years and attempts to revive it have been unsuccessful. In the <a class="location" data-layer-id="feature-13">village
                    of Mainalli</a>, made up of mostly Christian Siddis, several teenagers shared
                    with me that they aspired to play sports or act in Bollywood movies, which they viewed as their
                    ‘ticket to success.’

                <p>It is rare to find Hindu, Christian, and Muslim Siddis living in the same village or area. Generally,
                    Hindus tend to live in more dispersed and isolated areas because they own farmland. By contrast,
                    Christians and Muslims live in compact Siddi villages, or in larger villages that are also home to
                    non-Siddi Hindu populations. <a class="location" data-layer-id="feature-10">Gadagera</a> is a small, Christian Siddi village
                    that has its own church and a weekly Sunday service. Most Christian Siddis are Catholic and were
                    probably converted/baptized to Christianity after being brought to India by the Portuguese. The
                    greater Catholic Church sends non-Siddi priests into the smaller villages to conduct Sunday
                    services. Christian Siddi communities often have better educational outcomes due to the involvement
                    and financial support of church groups, which have set up schools and other facilities. </p>

                <p>Hindu and Christian Siddi people occasionally practice intermarriage with each other, but rarely
                    practice interracial marriage with non-Siddis. However, Muslim Siddis commonly marry non-Siddi
                    Muslims. Muslim Siddis are conversant in Kannada and Konkani (the two most common languages for
                    Siddis). However, they primarily speak Urdu, which is the language spoken by most Muslims in India.
                    <a class="location" data-layer-id="feature-14">The village of Bhurunaki</a> is predominantly a Hindu village but it has a
                    small population of Muslim Siddis. Here, a non-Siddi Muslim man has two wives—one of which is Siddi
                    and the other is not. Unlike Hindu or Christian Siddi families, who tend to live in their own
                    communities, Muslim Siddi families live in larger, predominantly Hindu villages. Discrimination
                    against Muslim Siddis is common when the group is small in proportion compared to the overall
                    population of the Hindu village.</p>

                    Muslim community. Several Siddis have interracial marriages in this community, and harmonious
                    relationships with their Hindu neighbors. They were quite happy with life in general. It appears
                    that if the Muslim Siddi community in a Hindu village is populous enough, they have no major
                    problems due to their strength in numbers. However, the smaller Muslim Siddi communities in Hindu
                    villages seem to have more communal issues, which could be partly explained by their smaller
                    population size.</p>

                    fell in love with the Christian Siddi man and was able to convince her family to approve the
                    relationship despite their reservations. Today, both families regularly socialize with each other.
                    These families have broken down their personal barriers to inter-caste, inter-racial, and
                    inter-religious marriage, but this is generally rare in Indian society. </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Siddis have lived in India for centuries, but very few Indians likely know about them. Siddis face
                    many of the challenges that other rural communities do, including lack of access to education,
                    healthcare, adequate housing, and finance. The status of Siddis within Indian communities may have
                    improved slightly since being recognized as a Scheduled Tribe, which allows access to certain
                    government benefits and protection under discrimination laws. However, Siddis still regularly
                    encounter caste-, religion-, and race-based discrimination, especially in areas farther from their
                    homeland. For this reason, many Siddis have a strong sense of place and an attachment to their
                    homeland. They have lived on these lands for decades, if not centuries, and identify as Indian.
                    Except for retaining some of the physical features of their African ancestors, the Siddis have
                    little-to-no cultural connection to Africa. Every Siddi that I spoke to said that they considered
                    themselves Indian because of how well they have integrated into the surrounding socio-cultural
                    landscape. They speak the same languages, dress the same way, eat the same food, and practice the
                    same religions as any other Indians in the area. To the Siddis, they are the same as anyone else
                    there, and their place attachment to the surrounding forests and landscapes is profound. </p>

                <p>I would like to thank Bowie State University for supporting me with a research grant to conduct my
                    fieldwork. I would like to thank all the Siddi families that welcomed me into their homes and
                    communities, and fed and lodged me in their humble homes. Most importantly, I thank the Siddis for
                    sharing their daily lives and their views about what it is like to be a Siddi with me. I would also
                    like to thank my driver, Rosario, who not only navigated many rough roads off the beaten path, but
                    also provided lively conversation throughout the trip. Finally, I reserve my deepest gratitude for
                    my field guide, Juje Siddi, without whom I would not have known where to begin. His personable
                    attitude, extensive network within the Siddi community, and immense knowledge about his people
                    provided me with a deep appreciation and understanding of the Siddi people that I would never have
                    gained without him.</p>
