                <p class="start">Why do people leave the homes they love? What role do climate and environment-related
                    stressors play in the decision to migrate? These questions are often raised in policy reports, news
                    media, and scholarly research. Prior to the intensification of Central American migration flows in
                    2018, when migrant caravans trudged through Mexico heading to North America, linkages between
                    migration and climate change were seldom referenced in popular media outlets. Journalistic reports
                    began to make these connections and gain traction with attention-grabbing headlines. Some media
                    outlets highlighted, for example, how climate change was the “unseen driver” triggering migration
                    from Guatemala (e.g, Semple 2019). While these news reports shifted the migration discourse in
                    popular media realms, they obfuscate the complexity of the decision to migrate and the multiple
                    variables influencing that decision (Moran-Taylor and Taylor 2021). Moreover, the impacts of
                    environmental change are often intensely localized and varied, as they interact with existing
                    social, political, economic, and demographic factors. To understand the many variables that
                    influence the decision to migrate, including climate change, it is essential to listen to migrants
                    and their families telling their own stories about their experiences over the past few decades.</p>
                <p>A country like Guatemala is especially vulnerable to climate change because half of its population
                    lives in rural areas and relies on rain-fed agriculture (Pons et al. 2017). Given the continued
                    debates about emigration to the United States, understanding the linkages between migration and
                    climate change is crucial and timely. Here, then, we consider these issues and offer a viewpoint
                    that comes from the perspectives of locals. These perspectives were gathered during our fieldwork in
                    2021 as well as our research into migration from Guatemala that spans 30 years.</p>
                <p>To look behind the headlines and probe deeper into the migration and climate change nexus, in
                    December of 2021 we set out to do preliminary ethnographic fieldwork in Guatemala’s Cuchumatán
                    highlands in the northwestern state of Huehuetenango. We conducted 28 informal interviews with both
                    male and female residents in communities stretching from Todos Santos in the west to Aldea
                    Climentoro in the east, Paquix in the south, and Tojquia to the north (Figure 1). Interviews
                    prompted residents with questions about general changes in the region and their livelihoods over the
                    past several decades. We did not prompt interviewees with any questions about climate change.</p>

                    Los Altos (1b). After Steinberg and Taylor (2008).</div>
                <p>This region is a largely Mam-speaking Maya area, but also includes Ladino communities in the eastern
                    part of Los Altos. Cuchumatán is an ancient toponym which either originally derived from Mam,
                    meaning “that which was brought together by great force” or Nahuatl, meaning “place of parrot
                    hunters” (Lovell 1992). We focused our research in Los Altos of Chiantla, the highest non-volcanic
                    region of all Central America, because this is an area of long-term out-migration (Steinberg and
                    Taylor 2008; Camus 2008) and because we have a long history of research in the area and have
                    developed a network of local families with whom we have established rapport over time. Our
                    interviews and landscape observations are contextualized within our research in Guatemala on
                    emigration to the United States over the last three decades, allowing us to also assess change over
                    time.</p>
                <h3>Geographic Context of Los Altos de Chiantla: “Forgotten by the State”</h3>
                <p>Guatemala is a small country, about the size of Louisiana in the United States, with about 17 million
                    people (versus Louisiana’s 4.6 million). The Cuchumatán highlands have four diverse altitudinal and
                    climate zones—<i>tierra caliente</i> (warm land) to the highest and coldest land known as Andean
                    region
                    (Lovell 1992; Recinos 1954); Los Altos de Chiantla lies in the region of the Cuchumatán Mountains
                    above 3000 m.a.s.l. and includes the communities of La Capellanía and Chancol (Figure 1). This
                    rugged region experiences frosts during the cold season and sits at about 3000 m.a.s.l. with average
                    annual temperatures below 10 degrees centigrade. The landscape, often shrouded in mists, stone walls
                    adorned with agaves, and sheep grazing remote mountain meadows, gives the impression of a place that
                    differs from the most conventional images of Central America (Steinberg and Taylor 2008).</p>
                <p>Los Altos de Chiantla remains one of the most isolated regions in Guatemala; it is neglected by the
                    state because of its remoteness from centralized decision-making, as well as because its lack of
                    economic importance to the state. Electricity, for example, did not reach the area until about the
                    early 2000s (Taylor 2005). And, it only did, because community members came together, petitioned for
                    it, and committed to dig their own holes for the electric posts—a project which included having to
                    provide a morning <i>refacción</i> (coffee and snack) for government workers too! Scant
                    government-funded infrastructure addresses water needs for household consumption. Most agriculture
                    in Los Altos is
                    rainfed. Taps for water for household consumption were created by locals. They pulled together the
                    funds to tap into local springs and to create a spot for water gathering. At a larger scale, even
                    though Huehuetenango is still mostly agrarian, “the state has done little to support smallholder
                    farmers” (Camus 2008:46). Although more than 25 years has passed since the Guatemalan government
                    signed the peace accords in 1996, formally ending nearly four decades of armed conflict and with
                    promises of rural development, overall, there is a lack of state interest in this remote rural area.

                    steep-sided valleys dotted with maize fields give way to patches of wheat, oats, potato fields, and
                    sheep pastures (Figures 2 and 3). The recently paved and busy two-lane road eventually reaches the
                    high plateau at La Capellanía and the landscape opens up to alpine grassy meadows (Figure 3). This
                    landscape provides for the people in the area who cultivate wheat, potatoes, broad beans, and who
                    raise sheep. The peaks of Los Altos de Chiantla provide firewood and other forest products.</p>
                <h3>Guatemalan Migration to the United States</h3>
                <p>Root causes of international migration from Guatemala to the United States include the following:
                    four decades of a long, bloody civil war; U.S. foreign policy; U.S. immigration policies, free trade
                    agreements, pervasive social, economic, and environmental inequalities, corruption, structural
                    violence, and everyday violence (Moran-Taylor 2008; Taylor et al. 2006). The economic decline
                    related to the global COVID-19 pandemic added to previous pressures to migrate.
                    Climate change and environmental issues also add to the complex mix of social and political factors
                    that drive migration. Guatemalan migration flows to the United States began in the late 1970s,
                    accelerated in the 1980s, and intensified by the 1990s, and continues to grow to the present day.
                    U.S.-bound migration is mature and a vital part of the social fabric for many families in Guatemala,
                    and, in fact, the economy in general.
                </p>
                <p>Although the <i>Departamento</i> (equivalent to state) of Huehuetenango is the largest sender of
                    migrants to
                    the United States in the country (Guatemalan National Census 2002; OIM 2021), we found, based on
                    interviews and our previous research, that emigration from the region of Los Altos de Chiantla is
                    not as mature as in other towns and villages throughout Guatemala. Locals say that U.S. emigration
                    began in the early 2000s, chiefly due to economic stagnation.</p>
                <h3>Exploring the Linkages between Migration and Climate Change in Guatemala</h3>
                <p>The linkages between migration and climate change are complex and not well understood (Moran-Taylor
                    and Taylor 2021). A growing body of research questions media and popular claims that climate change
                    will result in mass displacement. These scholars back away from such displacement claims, and seek a
                    more nuanced understanding of the role that climate plays among the multitude of factors that
                    contribute to the decision to migrate (e.g., de Haas 2023, de Sherbinin et al. 2022, Piguet 2010).
                    Geography matters when looking at the links between migration and climate change. And, in the case
                    of Guatemala, geography especially matters because of the variability in climate and topography over
                    short distances. Climate change in Central America and Guatemala is variable because of how complex
                    topography interacts with larger scale atmospheric conditions (Anderson et al. 2019; Pons et al.
                    2017), which interact to generate geographic variability of soils, poverty, and food insecurity. In
                    terms of climate model projections, forecasts suggest that future decreases in precipitation and
                    rising temperatures will reduce soil moisture and increase aridity throughout Central America
                    (Margin et al. 2014), influencing geographical and social conditions.</p>
                <p>The picture on the ground of this relationship between climate and migration varies over space.
                    Another factor complicating understanding the interactions between climate change and migration is
                    that most areas of Guatemala have been sending family members abroad for decades. This pattern that
                    includes both migrating and staying populations has permitted diversification of the economy, and,
                    in turn, perhaps allowed for more resilience as climate changes. We elaborate on examples of this
                    feedback loop later in the paper.</p>
                <h3>Migra Landscapes: “The American Dream Comes to the Cuchumatanes”</h3>
                <p>Los Altos de Chiantla is increasingly pulled and pushed into the world economy because of
                    international migration and its impacts that bring, as Stoll (2013) notes, “<i>the American dream to
                        the Cuchumatanes</i>.” Today migrants from this region are spread out in urban and rural areas
                    across the United States. Some migrants head to cities like Chicago, Washington D.C., Las Vegas,
                    Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and New York. Others find work in agriculture, poultry processing and
                    meat
                    packing plants, construction, landscaping, or service industry in states like Florida, Oklahoma,
                    California, New Jersey, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Delaware, and Virginia. According to
                    locals, despite the recent intensification of U.S. immigration and border policies, which make
                    journeys northward even more perilous, circuitous, and expensive, migrants pay around Q80-150
                    thousand (US $10-20 thousand) for their unauthorized journey. This is a vast increase from the US
                    $1500-$3000 coyotes charged for the journey from Huehuetenango to the United States 20 years ago
                    (House and Lovell 2001). So, how do migrants pay such a premium? To finance their travels migrants
                    often receive assistance from family (at home and abroad), friends, obtain bank or personal loans,
                    use any little plot of land, house, or vehicle as collateral, or even pawn animals or <i>traje
                        típicos</i>
                    (Moran-Taylor 2008; Stoll 2013; Heidbrink 2019). Increasingly, prior to migrating, some migrants get
                    recruited to commit to an employment site (e.g, poultry processing plant) in the United States and
                    then work to pay off the debt (House and Lovell 2001). Although since 2018 thousands of migrants
                    from Central America travelled in organized caravans as protection and to pool resources during the
                    hazardous journey, this type of journey was not mentioned during our conversations with locals in
                    Los Altos de Chiantla. Perhaps it was not practiced because Huehuetenango is a border state with
                    Mexico and thus migrants negotiate fewer borders or have more experience crossing into Mexico,
                    compared to Hondurans or Salvadorans who made up a large part of the migrant caravans.</p>
                <p>U.S.-bound migration from Los Altos de Chiantla results in a shortage of young people (18-45 years
                    old) to work as <i>jornaleros</i> in agriculture and construction. As a non-migrant local put it,
                    “it takes
                    forever to find somebody willing and with the knowledge to do these types of jobs.” Although many
                    people may leave due to lack of labor market prospects and because they want to earn a living in the
                    United States that will allow them to have a better quality of life at home and “to get ahead
                    (<i>economically</i>) quicker,” this labor drain adversely impacts local communities as more and
                    more look
                    north and less human capital is available in the region. In the end, however, it seems that the ones
                    reaping most of the benefits of U.S. migration are the ones left behind. Even though “<i>los
                        ausentes
                        siempre están presentes</i>,” (the absent are always present) with their material assets and
                    memories
                    (House and Lovell 2001), those who stay end up living in the homes built with remittances, using the
                    cars purchased by migrants, and staying behind with family. Additionally, those who stay behind do
                    not have to deal with the personal costs of migration: nostalgia for home, loneliness, and the
                    insecurity associated with the journey and life in another country (Moran-Taylor 2009). For the
                    migrants, then, the dream of building a better life in the Cuchumatanes is a reality that they
                    sponsor, but often do not get to experience because they fear that they will not be able to get back
                    into the United States if they leave for a visit to Guatemala. These migrants become stuck and live
                    a life in limbo – neither firmly in the United States nor Guatemala.</p>
                <p>International migration has resulted in many visible migration-related changes in migrant-sending
                    communities like Los Altos de Chiantla and its surroundings. As in other Guatemalan towns,
                    remittances help meet basic household needs, but also fuel an economic boom (Moran-Taylor 2008;
                    Taylor et al. 2006). The volume of remittances reaching Guatemalans is estimated at more than 19.2
                    billion dollars annually (The World Bank 2022), making remittances the country’s leading source of
                    foreign exchange. After remittances are used to meet basic needs, migrants build new houses, buy
                    cars, and invest in education and business creation. These investments shape the cultural landscape
                    of Los Altos (Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7). Migrant funds, for example, have stimulated a boom in house
                    and business constructions with vast ripple effects that are visible in the landscape: an increase
                    in transportation, factories producing construction materials (cement and block), ubiquitous
                    <i>ferreterías</i> (hardware stores), gas stations, and shops. This economic diversity leads to a
                    landscape
                    that is no longer solely reliant on agriculture, indeed, a “new rurality” exists (Hecht 2010), and
                    perhaps households that are more resilient in the face of climate change and the challenges that it
                    presents to agriculture.

                <p>This economic boom seen today in the Cuchumatanes is led in part, locals tell
                    us, by U.S. migration
                    in the first place. Many residents recount how income earned abroad enables a diversification in
                    household livelihoods. In terms of the built environment, and as is the case in other Latin American
                    countries with large out-migration, remittances allow locals to either expand existing homes or
                    build new, larger houses using a mix of materials and styles (see Figures 5, 6, and 7). Compare
                    these newly built houses with the traditional dwellings found in Los Altos (Figure 8).</p>

                <h3>Agricultural Livelihoods</h3>
                <p>Guatemala is a country where 40-50 percent of the population still lead agrarian livelihoods. While
                    many smallholder farmers continue to rely on agriculture in Los Altos de Chiantla, the high
                    elevations limit options. During colonial times the Cuchumatán highlands were overlooked, especially
                    during the age of cacao and indigo (Lovell 1992). The Spanish, however, began to eye this
                    northwestern region for its potential—not so much for crops, but for raising sheep and horses. The
                    high plateau, with its wide-ranging pastures, became a center for sheep production in colonial
                    Central America (Lovell 1992) – a practice that continues today (Figures 12 and 13).</p>

                <p>Owning sheep is a form of savings, locals told us. To meet household needs, owners can sell a sheep
                    for about $100. Increasingly, greater demand for lamb in other regions of Guatemala; especially
                    higher-end restaurants, helps promote the sheep economy. Occasionally, sheep are used for household
                    consumption. Sheep also are coveted for wool, particularly among artisan weavers in Momostenango, a
                    Maya K’iche’ town in the Department of Totonicapán with a long history of producing wool blankets
                    and clothing.</p>

                <p>Potatoes are an important crop in Los Altos de Chiantla, as well as in neighboring communities such
                    as Todos Santos (Figure 16). Like sheep, the Spanish introduced new varieties of potatoes from the
                    Andes (Lovell 1983, 1992). Locals also invest in other crops that can endure the higher elevations,
                    like <i>avena</i> (oats) and <i>habas</i> (fava beans).</p>

                    with corn tortillas and beans, and sometimes even rice (Figure 12).</p>

                    Los Altos de Chiantla. This family spoke with us about their daily reliance on potatoes.</div>
                <p>Increasingly, people in Los Altos de Chiantla diversify their livelihoods through agrarian
                    entrepreneurial ties with residents of the neighboring Mayan Mam town of Todos Santos (a community
                    below the high plateau to the west, set in a deep valley). Many Todos Santeros are heavily involved
                    in agriculture and are well-known for growing a variety of vegetables (e.g,. carrots, broccoli,
                    beets, kale, etc.) for local and export markets to North America and Europe. Non-traditional crops
                    have become one of Guatemala’s biggest export earners (Hamilton and Fischer 2003). Farmers from the
                    Todos Santos region are also known for their large-scale potato production. Todos Santeros have
                    strategized and expanded their agricultural fields by leasing land for potato production from
                    families in Los Altos de Chiantla (figure 16). This land is available because it is not used for the
                    production of staples like maize and beans. Also, Todos Santeros have the capital for the fertilizer
                    inputs (often chicken manure) that make these lands productive for potato cultivation. They hire
                    locals to work as <i>jornaleros</i> (both males and females), who earn Q50 per day (approximately
                    $7). This
                    agricultural strategy allows Todos Santeros to dominate the potato production in the high plateau of
                    the Cuchumatanes and helps many families in Los Altos de Chiantla supplement their household income.
                </p>
                <p>Todos Santos has a longer history of U.S.-bound migration (e.g., Burrell 2013). This history of
                    migration is more mature than areas like Los Altos de Chiantla, and the accumulated remittances
                    provide farmers in Todos Santos with more capital to invest in land and agriculture close to home
                    and in neighboring communities. This is also the case in other communities in Guatemala, like the
                    Mayan farmers in Almolonga, Quetzaltenango who invest in land and non-traditional crops in the
                    nearby community of San Cristóbal, Totonicapán (Moran-Taylor and Taylor 2010). While this strategy
                    allows Todos Santeros to carry on an agrarian-centered lifestyle, the downside for people in Los
                    Altos de Chiantla is that they end up with land that is exhausted after heavy inputs of fertilizers
                    and pesticides.</p>
                <p> More recently, tourism has begun to play a small role in the economy of Huehuetenango. In 2019 the
                    area experienced an increase in international tourism (INGUAT 2020). But as borders closed and
                    international travel came to a halt because of the COVID pandemic, national tourism flourished as
                    Guatemalans set out to explore their country. As one interviewee highlighted, “it’s almost as if
                    suddenly, Guatemalans from around the country discovered their own country and its little hidden,
                    forgotten corners.” Helping to foster this new interest in Huehuetenango are the Rural Tourism
                    Organization of Huehuetenango and INGUAT (Guatemalan Institute for Tourism)—government entities that
                    launched tourism marketing strategies promoting the area’s natural beauty (e.g., lakes, lagoons,
                    cenotes, rivers), hikes and protected areas, agricultural tourism, including llama tourism,
                    archaeological sites, and cultural sites like the Mayan towns of Todos Santos and San Juan Atitán.

                <h3>Exploring the Linkages between Migration, Livelihoods, and Climate Change</h3>
                <p>During our conversations about the links between migration and climate change, to avoid influencing
                    discourse and perceptions, we were careful not to elicit stories using the term climate change.
                    Instead, we asked about the environment in general, agricultural experiences with weather changes
                    during different seasons, and crop losses or successes. And, to further delve into our narrators’
                    association between migration and climate change, we asked locals about out-migration trends, their
                    perceptions as to why people migrate, impacts of migration (both loss of people and remittances),
                    and changes in agricultural livelihoods in general.</p>
                <p>Locals say that one way in which people’s livelihoods have improved is through improvements in the
                    physical environment. Through the government’s INAB reforestation program (which started in the
                    early 2000s), residents were incentivized and compensated to plant <i>pinabete</i> (<i>Abies
                        guatemalensis</i>—Guatemalan fir) in their plots of land and in surrounding hills. This
                    reforestation
                    program, according to locals, has led to greater soil preservation, less erosion, better crops, and
                    even the emergence of water springs.</p>

                <p> Although precipitation variability is among the many challenges smallholder families face in
                    Guatemala (Anderson et al. 2019), most farmers indicate that this past year (2021) they experienced
                    good potato production and were able to sell at higher prices. For instance, farmers received about
                    Q100 (~$13) per <i>quintal</i> (100 pounds) of potatoes. Although farmers suffered a frost in their
                    crops
                    in August 2021, this unexpected cold snap change did not result in significant crop loss. This
                    environmental shock is often referred to as <i>hielera</i> (low temperatures that freeze the leaves
                    of the
                    plant and that leads to lower harvests), paradoxically, also known as “<i>quemando la hoja</i>”
                    (burning
                    the leaf). Despite this environmental shock, most farmers say that they were able to earn enough to
                    cover expenses, bank some profits, and to save potato seeds for the following year. Undoubtedly,
                    environmental shocks like <i>hieleras</i> are part of the risks many farmers endure. And, in
                    Guatemala,
                    such risks come with limited access to government programs to ameliorate impacts.</p>
                <p>Past studies have noted the linkages between migration and environmental conditions (favorable and
                    unfavorable) and show how this relationship varies across geographic contexts (Moran-Taylor and
                    Taylor 2021; Hunter et al. 2015, 2017). Our preliminary ethnographic fieldwork suggests that the
                    association between out-migration and environmental factors is highly localized. In the nearby
                    Department of Alta Verapaz, for example, stories abound of Mayan farmers impacted by drought, flood,
                    bankruptcy, and starvation, and of farmers having to pick up and leave Guatemala (Lustgarten 2020).
                    In Los Altos de Chiantla, economic motives, however, emerge as the main reason for migration.
                    Environmental conditions and disruptions to agricultural livelihoods because of changes in the
                    environment are not cited by locals as the most important factors in the decision to migrate. Locals
                    told us that households in this area use a variety of strategies to cope with economic hardships,
                    mainly by sending a household member to pursue off-farm employment (e.g., in banks, schools) in the
                    nearby municipal capital of Huehuetenango, diversifying employment in their community (e.g., wage
                    workers in construction sites, fetching and delivering sand for construction jobs), and leasing
                    plots of land for agriculture to nearby neighbors in the town of Todos Santos.</p>

                <h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>
                <p>Understanding the relationship between migration and climate change is important because it is tied
                    to the livelihoods and food security for so many who rely, at least in part, on agriculture in
                    Guatemala. To begin to chip away at the question of how linkages between migration and climate
                    change unfold in Guatemala, we headed to the Cuchumatanes in Huehuetenango. This fieldwork is part
                    of a larger project that also looks at this relationship in the Dry Corridor of Guatemala and
                    Honduras. Following Hunter et al. (2017), the goal in our larger project is to explore this complex
                    relationship across spatial scales and to consider both regional and more localized patterns,
                    assessing both changes in the landscape and local perceptions and experiences—which don’t
                    necessarily map neatly onto one another.</p>
                <p>The region of Los Altos de Chiantla, once isolated, and predominantly rural, fits into descriptions
                    of “new ruralities of Latin America and the Caribbean.” This change in regional economy is not only
                    evident in the words of residents, but, in our observations, in landscape and livelihood changes. As
                    some scholars highlight, “the rural sector has changed, and rurality in Latin America cannot be
                    understood in the same parameters used in the last decade.” (Baskovich and Flores Arias Uijtewaal
                    2019). There are, however, still many challenges facing the rural sector, especially in places like
                    Los Altos de Chiantla that have long been forgotten by the state.</p>
                <p>Perhaps this new rurality explains why locals do not bring climate change to the forefront of their
                    discussions when they consider what propels so many to leave the homes they love. In fact, maybe
                    this new rurality is an adaptation to changing social, economic, and environmental realities (e.g.,
                    Urquijo et al. 2018; Yarnall and Price 2010). Simply, their livelihoods are far more diversified and
                    less reliant on agriculture. Yet, even residents who rely almost exclusively on agriculture, do not
                    bring climate and climate change to the forefront of their discussions and do not say it is a driver
                    of migration. Rather, the dearth of economic opportunities and peoples’ desires to “get ahead
                    quicker” become the principal triggers for migration from this corner of the Cuchumatanes in
                    northwestern Guatemala.</p>
