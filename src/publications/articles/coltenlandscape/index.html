                <p><i>This is the first in a forthcoming series of occasional essays that revisit individual
                        geographer’s
                        early encounters with a particular landscape. The authors have been asked to examine how that
                        landscape might have changed since their initial observation and how their professional
                        perspective might have altered their understanding of that scene. It is our hope that these
                        essays deepen our understanding of the subjectivity and objectivity of place, personal and
                        professional experience </i></p>
                </br>
                <h3>Landscape of Survival</h3>
                <p>Repeat photography reveals both obvious and subtle changes in common landscapes. Dan Arreola and
                    colleagues (Finn et al. 2009), William Wyckoff (2011), the Vales (Vale and Vale 1983 and 1994), and
                    others (Meyer and Young 2018; Bass 2013) have produced significant contributions to this genre of
                    geographic study. Often the temporal scale of such work exceeds a normal lifetime or career and thus
                    enables the linking of scenes captured by one photographer with those repeated by a different
                    observer more than a generation later. A goal of the second photographer is to frame the scene so
                    that the viewer can compare the more distant past with the very recent past to document and
                    comprehend change.
                </p>
                <p>This essay takes a different approach. I examine landscapes I viewed before my professional career
                    began and then revisited decades later. The objective is to observe physical change of the
                    landscape, but also to consider how my perception of it changed through the course of a career. How
                    have years of training and professional experience altered how I see, respond to, and understand a
                    landscape encountered decades before?
                </p>
                <p>I report on three landscapes that were highly influential as I pursued my college education and, in
                    subtle but significant ways, affected my research. The first place is a small cave above <a
                        class="location" data-layer-id="PineCreek">Pine Creek</a>
                    in the Black Hills of South Dakota (Fig. 2), a
                    location I visited
                    briefly as I hitch-hiked from Louisiana to Oregon in the summer of 1972. Although I was there for
                    only a few hours, it proved to be both life-saving (literally) and, in quite unexpected ways. an
                    abiding touchstone for work I undertook much later. The other two places I merely passed through
                    that same year -- <a class="location" data-layer-id="Keystone">Keystone</a> and <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="RapidCity">Rapid City</a>, South Dakota -- but they underwent devastating change
                    that summer and now exemplify vastly different approaches to disaster recovery and anticipation that
                    I only came to comprehend as my career centered on disasters.</p>
                <p>Considering landscape change within the scope of a lifetime and from one person’s perspective is
                    fundamentally different from the repeat photography that includes pairs of pictures – one taken by a
                    professional photographer and the second by a geographer seeking to replicate the original image at
                    a later date to document change. Here, I seek to reveal changes in my perspective of a landscape
                    that resulted from long-term academic pursuits. As a college drop-out and before beginning my
                    training in geography, I traveled camera-less in 1972. The images from that era draw on an
                    assortment of historical photos taken by journalists and government officials. I returned to those
                    places in 2017 to revisit settings and images that were seared into my memory decades ago and used
                    my own camera to capture a landscape that endured little change (the cave) and also places that
                    underwent significant alterations with different fundamental goals in terms of public risk.</p>

                <h3>Headed Towards Disaster</h3>
                <p>Traveling along the interstate highway system without a car, as I did in 1972, dramatically alters
                    your view of the roadside. One progresses in spurts. Often a hitchhiker spends hours on a
                    traffic-less on-ramp to an interstate highway, followed by a short sprint to another intersection,
                    always awaiting that long ride with a friendly and alert driver. I set out from <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> , headed to Oregon at around 10:00 am on June 8, 1972.
                    Hitchhiking on the
                    interstate was illegal there, and I had to remain at the lower end of on-ramps to evade state
                    troopers. When deposited at a ramp with no traffic, I hiked some distance through Madison to find a
                    busier location. By late afternoon I had passed Madison, and now stood by the highway somewhere
                    beyond <a class="location" data-layer-id="BlueEarth">Blue Earth</a>, Minnesota.</p>
                <p>As dusk was falling, I was contemplating finding a place to camp for the night when a driver in a
                    sporty, but well-used MG coupe, pulled over and offered to take me across South Dakota. He had been
                    driving non-stop for 30 hours from New Jersey and needed someone to keep him awake on his final leg
                    to <a class="location" data-layer-id="RapidCity">Rapid City</a>. I was expected to earn my ride with
                    lively conversation.</p>
                <p>We set off into the night swapping tales of our adventures, but the car broke down in the pre-dawn
                    hours somewhere on the Great Plains, and we spent the next few hours searching for a mechanic (yes,
                    some gas stations still had mechanics on-site) and getting the car rolling again. After that
                    sleepless night and some time watching a creative mechanic coax the car back to life, we reached
                    Rapid City before noon on June 9 and went our separate ways. All in all, it had been a highly
                    successful, if not restful, day riding my thumb – Milwaukee to Rapid City (about 850 miles) in just
                    over 24 hours.</p>

                <p>I wanted to explore the nearby Black Hills and made my way through <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="RapidCity">the city</a> and up to the tourist
                    town of <a class="location" data-layer-id="Keystone">Keystone</a> - gateway to the Black Hills (Fig.
                    1). Its commercial
                    kitsch of motels, restaurants, and gift shops was unappealing, and I sought a more rugged setting.
                    So I hiked more than hitched rides up the road paralleling Battle Creek that was lined with RV
                    campgrounds and rental cottages. It was a far cry from the back country camping I was seeking.
                    Finally, a teenager on a dirt bike gave me a lift to a US Forest Service campground at <a
                        class="location" data-layer-id="HorseThiefLake">Horse Thief Lake</a>. I wandered through a
                    collection of pop-up trailers and large
                    family tents at the formal campground and found a trail leading into a narrow mountain gorge. </p>

                    supper, and began to settle in for the night - relieved that I had found an ideal site. My journal
                    entry read: “Have had splendid weather for hitching, but it may rain tonight.”</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ominous clouds proved my forecast correct and a gentle rain disrupted my hope for a restful night.
                    Although I considered myself weather savvy, I hadn’t outfitted myself with a tent. My expectation of
                    an unvarying dry climate across the semi-arid plains was thoroughly undermined by actual conditions.
                    Fortunately, I noticed a small cave about 10-15 feet up a modest slope above my creekside campsite
                    (Fig. 2). It looked like a good shelter, so I doused my fire, and scrambled up towards the dark
                    opening. The cave’s mouth was about 10 feet high, and the cavity extended a dozen or so feet back
                    into the cliff. I was confident it would provide a weary traveler with ample shelter from a light
                    rain, so I crawled into my sleeping bag, read until darkness fell, and drifted off to sleep.</p>
                <p>In the middle of the night, I was awakened by riotous thunder and spectacular lightning. During the
                    frequent flashes of brilliant illumination, I was stunned to see a raging river, where a tiny creek
                    had been, coursing by the cave’s mouth. The mad torrent carried trunks of fallen trees toward the
                    campground that I had walked through the previous afternoon. Circumstances had changed dramatically
                    since sunset. No longer was simply avoiding a drenching the priority; survival jumped to the head of
                    the list. I had to choose between staying put and hoping the water did not rise any further or try
                    to scramble up a steep and completely unfamiliar rock face in the rain (Fig. 2). I wasn’t sure how
                    climbable the slope was even in dry, daylight conditions. Although I was fairly athletic, I had zero
                    mountaineering skills. I was familiar with thunderstorms, but not in this geologic setting, and I
                    had little experience to draw on. Where I came from in the deep South such downpours tended to be
                    short lived, so I stayed put and just kept an eye on the raging flood.</p>
                <p>My weather expectations served me well. After the rain let up, the torrent subsided, and by daybreak,
                    the creek was nearly back in its channel. So, I loaded up my gear, hung my wet sleeping bag on the
                    top of my backpack to dry, and trekked out of the gorge. When I reached the main campground, I
                    realized that others had undergone far worse than me. The pop-ups, tents, and vehicles were all
                    gone. I don’t know if they were washed away or if the owners escaped in the night. </p>

            <section id="5" class="scene" data-scene-id="place5" title="ToRushmore">
                <p>Still not realizing the scale of the event, and as long as I was in the neighborhood, I naively began
                    a hike towards <a class="location" data-layer-id="MountRushmore">Mount Rushmore</a> to view the
                    famous landmark. Almost
                    immediately, a family stopped to give me a ride, and as I climbed into their station wagon, they
                    proclaimed, “You’re alive!” This was an unexpected greeting since I didn’t know why they might have
                    thought otherwise. As we drove towards Mount Rushmore, they relayed the news that there had been
                    deadly flooding in nearby Keystone and Rapid City. It began sinking in that the storm was truly
                    disastrous. My wet sleeping bag was insignificant in the grander scheme of things.</p>
                <p>At the <a class="location" data-layer-id="MountRushmore">national memorial</a> thick fog completely
                    obscured the famous stone presidential sculptures. I
                    found myself in a makeshift evacuation shelter and temporary morgue. I spoke to people, wrapped in
                    blankets sipping coffee, who had ridden on the tops of their large RV’s as the flood floated them
                    down Battle Creek valley, where I had wandered searching for a camp site the previous day. Others
                    recounted being awakened in their small rental cabins as they careened with the flood towards
                    Keystone. I observed some campers mobilizing to venture into Rapid City to aid with the recovery
                    efforts. Everywhere I turned, strangers were assisting strangers. Compassion permeated the Visitors
                    Information Center, converted into a disaster triage shelter. My journal entry noted that the tragic
                    circumstances seemed to bring out the best in people. Spontaneous assistance, as I learned over the
                    ensuing decades, is common and a vitally essential component of disaster recovery.</p>

                <p>I also learned later that the Weather Service reported that this storm was an exceptional rainfall
                    event. Easterly winds drove moist air up and over the Black Hills forcing heavy rains. The absence
                    of strong upper-level winds caused the thunderstorms to stagnate over the upper basin of several
                    streams and rainfall totals reached 12 to 15 inches over 4 to 6 hours (Fig. 3). Runoff from this
                    deluge roared down the tributaries of <a class="location" data-layer-id="RapidCreek">Rapid Creek</a>
                    towards <a class="location" data-layer-id="RapidCity">Rapid City</a>. A dam upstream from the city

                <p>While some early reports suggested the dam failure was a major cause of downstream damage, it only
                    added a modest amount of water to the massive discharge issuing from the Black Hills and roaring
                    through the low-lying sections of town, tossing cars and mobile homes into jumbled heaps (Fig. 4 &
                    5). The water flowed by my cave refuge, fed into Battle
                    Creek and joined the torrent that overwhelmed Keystone, destroying about two-thirds of that tourist
                    town. Overall, 230 people died and another 3,000 individuals suffered injuries due to the flooding
                    that night. Damage totals reached $160 million (or $1.2 billion in 2024 dollars) (NOAA 1972). </p>

                </div>
                <p>Society tends to measure disasters by deaths and dollars of damages. The 1972 flood would have hit
                    NOAA’s “billion dollar” mark using 2024 dollars and may have earned a major disaster declaration if
                    that option had existed at the time. As I learned during my professional career, disasters can
                    inspire change, sometimes in the form of better preparation and mitigation. The 1972 event in South
                    Dakota, to my mind, prompted enduring improvements through major reconfiguration of Rapid City’s
                    urban landscape but less so in Keystone. Steps taken to reduce risk are one form of change, but just
                    as often places are allowed to continue to deteriorate over time, especially when there are no
                    repeat events. According to the geographer Lindsey McEwen (McEwen et al. 2017), flood memories can
                    be short-lived. As time passes, residents impacted by extreme events can lose their sense of
                    urgency, and local leaders can begin to pursue seemingly economically advantageous land uses that
                    place people at risk. Development of gambling casinos on the Mississippi Coast after Hurricane
                    Camille in 1969 are evidence of the lure of tax revenue eclipsing memories of a devastating storm
                    surge (Colten and Giancarlo 2011). </p>

                    After more than 30 years as a practicing geographer who has researched the historical geography of
                    hazards, I revisited the cave above Pine Creek in 2017. To get there, after participating in the
                    South Dakota State Geography Convention, I drove across South Dakota in a rental car and made the
                    ascent into the Black Hills with ease.

                <h3>Keystone</h3>
                <p>I spent very little time in <a class="location" data-layer-id="Keystone">Keystone</a> in 1972. During
                    my brief visit, I
                    walked along the main street and made my exit on the road up Battle Creek as quickly as possible.
                    The commercial strip in 2017, lined with tourist-oriented businesses, seemed familiar enough,
                    repaired from the flood and updated. Post-flood reports indicate the town suffered massive damage
                    and at least 10 fatalities. A local historian observed, “A lot of the shops on Main Street were just
                    flooded out, mudded” (Fig. 6) (KOTA 2022). As is typical following a disaster, media attention
                    focused on the larger city that suffered the most dramatic damage, Rapid City in this case. Keystone
                    was an afterthought for the national and regional media. In the intervening years, Keystone’s
                    restoration quickly transformed the narrow space along Main Street and the flood diminished in the
                    local memory. </p>

                <p>Faux frontier architectural styles adorn the restaurants, gift shops, and hotels with names that
                    connect to local historical themes: Native Americans, gold mining, or pioneer settlement (Figs.
                    7-8). There are no longer traces of the damage, and the community has made considerable investments
                    to fully reinvigorate the commercial strip where it stood a half century before. The local museum
                    celebrates gold mining history, while also acknowledging the flood, and the community held a
                    memorial service on the 50th anniversary in 2022. In addition, there is a memorial to the flood
                    victims (Fig. 9), so the memory has not been erased. Nonetheless, the overt presence of the disaster
                    has largely faded from the landscape and memory. What is notable from a hazards geography
                    perspective is that Keystone has rebuilt in harm’s way and has distanced itself from the painful
                    experience of the 1972 flood.</p>

                    I drove out of Keystone up the same road along Battle Creek I had traveled in 1972 (Fig. 2). After
                    arriving at <a class="location" data-layer-id="Campground">Horse Thief Lake Campground</a>, I made
                    one false start up a
                    parallel canyon before rediscovering the correct trail. I was surprised to find my 1972 camp sites
                    and the cave quite easily and took the pictures included here (Figs. 1 and 10). Comparing historical
                    and contemporary photographs, I saw the site had undergone no noticeable change. But upon returning
                    to the scene, however, I realized that my memory had compressed the width of the gorge, but
                    exaggerated the cave’s elevation above the stream bed. My response to my earlier experience also
                    underwent a change. Standing at the cave’s mouth it was obvious that a huge amount of precipitation
                    had to fall to fill that gorge with a raging torrent. I also realized that there was no way I could
                    have scrambled up the rock face above the cave during a thunderstorm (Fig. 10). Visiting this
                    landscape confirmed that I had been extremely fortunate and that the cave truly provided a
                    lifesaving shelter above the flood.

                <p>I did not venture back down into <a class="location" data-layer-id="RapidCity">Rapid City</a> after
                    the
                    flood in 1972. The
                    fragmentary accounts circulating at the Mt. Rushmore visitors center gave the impression that the
                    entire
                    city had been wiped out when the dam collapsed. In my naivety about flooding and the topography of
                    Rapid
                    City, I was unable to imagine that the damage would have been restricted to low lying areas, and I
                    didn’t want to add a mouth to be fed in the emergency situation. So I struck out into the wilds.
                    After a
                    few days camping in the Black Hills, I headed westward and only caught snippets of news about the
                    impacts since hitchhiking was not ideal for following breaking news. Although the event stayed vivid
                    in
                    my mind as something in the past, I did not follow up to investigate the long-term impacts. But in
                    the
                    wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, It came back to me strongly, and became a bridge between my early

                    then current experiences. </p>

                        data-layer-id="RapidCity">Rapid City</a>. He made a compelling case
                    that the success of his administration included several key actions. Central to the response was the
                    use
                    of federal dollars to enable flood victims to relocate out of the floodplain via the creation of a
                    massive park along the floodplain that was free of residential or commercial development. These two
                    efforts together significantly reduced ongoing flood risk to individuals and the community more
                    broadly.
                    Indeed, the city’s public works director, who had witnessed several previous floods, argued
                    persuasively
                    that, “we cannot sentence the survivors to one more night on the suicidal flood plain" (South Dakota
                    Public Broadcasting 2022). To pursue this path, the city turned down federal dollars to rebuild the
                    trailer park that had been washed away. Instead, the city council approved a motion to prohibit
                    rebuilding residences in the floodplain. A subsequent report by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
                    advised
                    against a larger flood retention reservoir, and instead recommended a greenway along Rapid Creek
                    (USACE
                    1973). Tapping federal sources, the city secured low interest loans that residents could use to
                    vacate
                    their houses and rebuild in safe areas. It has steadfastly maintained its restrictions on developing
                    in
                    the floodplain.</p>

                <p>Strikingly, In the era before FEMA and the growth of formal academic hazards studies, Rapid City
                    moved away from the traditional reliance on structural approaches, such as levees and dams, and
                    embraced land-use mitigation that had been touted by Gilbert White since the 1940s. The city has
                    created a residence-free green corridor that serves as a multi-purpose public park paralleling <a
                        class="location" data-layer-id="RapidCreek">Rapid
                        Creek </a> (Fig. 11). Fittingly, the city named its Memorial Park (Fig. 12)
                    to honor those who perished in the flood and has used it effectively to sustain the memory of the
                    1972 flood. Successive administrations have used the memorial to fend off attempts by developers to
                    encroach onto the floodplain. In an interview with the former mayor in 2017, we discussed his call
                    to me in 2005 and how he spent years since the 1972 flood advocating for flood mitigation through
                    land-use approaches. He is convinced that the approach adopted by the city has proven successful.

                <h3>Repeat Visit</h3>
                <p>Now, over 50 years since my first visit to the Black Hills and nearly 20 years since my immersion in
                    the post-Katrina disaster discussions, I see the cave above Pine Creek, Keystone, and Rapid City in
                    a very different light. There was no record other than my laconic journal entry of my escape from
                    the raging flood. Yet that event remained strong in my memory, and probably led me to hazards
                    research. But it was not part of my regular work. I sometimes used it in my classes to emphasize the
                    threat of flash floods and the importance of safe development. The political leaders of Rapid City
                    worked diligently and tirelessly to overcome the tendency to forget tragedies. Their Memorial Park
                    serves as a heavily used reminder and a safety buffer against a repeat disaster. Since the call from
                    Mayor Burnett in the wake of Katrina in 2005, I have often considered the contrast between Rapid
                    City and New Orleans whose response to flooding engaged me personally and professionally. I think
                    about how the mayor recounted his city’s program to remove people from the floodplain. I know I
                    listened skeptically because the scale of the disaster in New Orleans was so much larger. Yet, I
                    shared and share his hope to provide a more durable means to reduce risk than levees subject to
                    failure. The greenway in Rapid City remains a viable swath of safety. I worry for New Orleans. The
                    massive engineered embankments that took decades to fund and build after a 1965 hurricane failed in
                    2005. Now after years of reinforcement they are threatened with obsolescence as global warming
                    pushes sea levels well above the base level used in their original design. I imagine repeat
                    photography of these two places, one today, another 50 years hence. New Orleans’ population remains
                    behind the levees, armed with a false sense of security and an increasingly susceptible protection
                    system. With global warming Rapid City might see rainfall totals that exceed the 1972 storms, but by
                    preserving open space along the floodway, it reduces threats to people and personal property. </p>
