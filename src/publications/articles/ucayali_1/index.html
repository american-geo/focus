                        <p>
                            Media reports from the Brazilian Amazon continue to
                            raise much concern over the fate of the Amazon and
                            its peoples. During the last half century, forests
                            have been cut down or degraded from cattle ranching,
                            illegal logging and mining, roads, agribusiness
                            development, and colonization schemes; fish
                            populations have dwindled, and climate change and
                            dam construction are affecting the hydrology of the
                            Amazon River, threatening biodiversity, the
                            livelihoods of indigenous and folk peoples, and the
                            world's climate (Ferrante and Fearnside 2020; Nobre
                            and Nobre 2020; Walker 2021). Yet, one third of the
                            Amazon is found in neighboring countries, mainly to
                            the west, where formative tributaries like the
                            Ucayali, Marañón, and Napo rivers in Peru descend
                            from the Andes into the Amazon lowlands, bringing
                            the waters that drive flooding, carry sediments, and
                            enable long-distance fish migrations (Junk et al.
                            2007; Latrubesse et al. 2017; Anderson et al. 2018).
                            Although not isolated from the complex forces
                            shaping dynamics in Brazil, the situation in western
                            Amazonia is less well known.

                            To gain a perspective on how the region is changing,
                            we undertook a 1000 km trip down the Ucayali River
                            between the cities of Pucallpa and Iquitos in Peru.
                            Each of us has been conducting research on
                            indigenous and folk peoples' (ribereños) livelihoods
                            in the Peruvian Amazon for the past 20-30 years and
                            we have been collaborating closely for nearly a
                            decade on a large-scale study on rural livelihoods
                            and poverty in the region, known as the

                            On June 12, 2018, a couple of days prior to the
                            beginning of the FIFA World Cup in Russia, we
                            embarked on the Carlitos (Figure 1) in Pucallpa and
                            over the span of 12 days, we descended the Ucayali
                            northward to the city of Iquitos on the Amazon River
                            (Figure 2).

                            the distance by boat is greater than 1000 km because
                            of the sinuously meandering course of the Ucayali
                            (Abizaid 2005; Schwenk et al. 2017)(Figure 3).
                            Following in the footsteps of 19th century explorers
                            like William Herndon, Paul Marcoy and Antonio
                            Raimondi, we sought to gain a regional perspective.
                            We visited settlements previously identified from
                            community histories compiled during our PARLAP
                            survey and pulled-in at sites along the way where
                            something interesting caught our eye. Our stops
                            included important towns, such as
                            <a class="location" data-layer-id="figure-2c"
                                >Contamana</a

                                >Requena</a
                            >, which were originally established as Franciscan
                            missions; we also stopped at smaller towns and
                            riverine communities, fishing camps and logging
                            posts. At each stop, we visited local markets,
                            agricultural fields, fishing grounds and other areas
                            of interest, and talked to people to inform our
                            observations. By the time we reached Iquitos on June
                            22, just before the San Juan festivities—the most
                            important regional celebration in the Peruvian
                            Amazon— we had visited some 30 different sites
                            (Figure 2), providing us with unique perspective on
                            how this understudied region is changing.

                            Amazonian rivers have always functioned as natural
                            highways. People have used canoes and rafts since
                            prehistory (Lathrap 1973) but by the mid-19th
                            century, steamships began to transit up and down the
                            Amazon. By the 1950s, diesel engine boats displaced
                            the steamers. Today, a full gamut of watercraft
                            navigates the Ucayali (Salonen et al. 2012). Canoes
                            are still used for local travel in some places and
                            the occasional raft can be seen drifting downriver
                            with logs, durable goods, or live fish (Figure 4).
                            Large lanchas offer regular passenger and cargo
                            service between Pucallpa and Iquitos, stopping in
                            selected towns and communities along the way, many
                            of which function as intermediary hubs between the
                            cities and other rural communities (Figure 5).
                            Smaller boats privately-operated as river buses
                            (colectivos) are more common within a day's travel
                            from the cities; they stop anywhere en route upon
                            request (Figure 6).

                            Peque-peques, personal boats powered by a small
                            air-cooled engine--similar to those on a gas-powered
                            lawnmower-- attached to a long shaft and a small
                            propeller have become commonplace (Figure 7). In the
                            last decade, powerful speedboats, known as rápidos,
                            have begun offering regular passenger service with
                            few stops between cities and larger towns within a
                            10-hour trip, i.e., Atayala, Contamana, Orellana
                            (from Pucallpa); Requena and Nauta (from Iquitos)
                            (Figure 8). Travel is about 3-4 times faster and
                            more comfortable than on a lancha or colectivo but
                            the cost is prohibitive for most people; rápidos run
                            along the main rivers only.

                            For many, improved river access and transportation
                            are creating new livelihood opportunities, however,
                            access in the region remains spatially and socially
                            uneven (Webster et al. 2016), as the COVID-19
                            pandemic has come to show (Takasaki et al. 2021).
                            People in towns and communities in peri-urban areas
                            have a wider range of options to travel or transport
                            produce, and to do so more frequently and
                            affordably. In contrast, travel and mobility for
                            people in remote communities, especially those on
                            tributaries that penetrate deep into the upland
                            forests, are constrained by the lack of regular boat
                            service, limited navigability during the low water
                            season, large distances and high sinuosity of
                            rivers, and by availability and cost of fuel. A trip
                            from Saweto, an Asháninka indigenous community on
                            the Upper Tamaya near the border with Brazil, about
                            160 km (Euclidean) from Pucallpa, takes up to three
                            full days and a fare costs about 90 S/. (about three
                            days wage). In contrast, a trip from a community at
                            a similar distance on the Upper Ucayali only takes
                            26 hours and the fare is less than half. Even along
                            the main rivers, travel times increase by about 25
                            percent during the low water season (Tenkanen et al.
                            2015), as the river becomes shallow and side
                            channels dry up; boat operators must be vigilant to
                            avoid hitting sandbanks or submerged logs. In many
                            riverine communities, people face considerable
                            difficulties getting in and out as the vast
                            floodplain empties when water levels drop, leaving
                            them stranded inland. We witnessed this at Nuevo
                            Encanto de Suni, across from Orellana, where it took
                            us more than an hour by foot to reach the community
                            from the river's edge.

                            Government approved this 20 year-concession to
                            maintain a permanent navigable channel for large
                            vessels (Figure 9) along the Huallaga, Marañón,
                            Ucayali and Amazonas rivers to a Chinese consortium
                            (Neyra 2020); it is anticipated that 22 km of the
                            Ucayali would be dredged. The mega-project was
                            clearly on people's minds as we passed through.
                            While taking us to a nearby lake, local authorities
                            from Victoria reported that people in the region,
                            mainly Kukama Kukamiria indigenous people, were
                            deeply concerned that the planned dredging will
                            negatively affect fish, which are critical to their
                            livelihoods and culture, and were thus organizing to
                            resist. Indigenous organizations, environmental
                            groups, and the Catholic church have repeatedly
                            called for the cancellation of the mega-project,
                            arguing that the social and environmental impacts
                            would be significant, that local consultation was
                            questionable, and that the project's financial
                            viability is uncertain (Berjón and Cadenas 2018; La
                            República 2020). Environmental Impact Assessments
                            (EIA) have corroborated such claims (La República
                            2020), and Hidrovía remained stalled. Still, the
                            project has not been totally abandoned. In fact, the
                            Ministry of Transportation recently extended the
                            concession to 23 years and approved an increase in
                            the number of reaches to be dredged. Hidrovía is
                            included in Peru's 2019 National Infrastructure Plan
                            for Competitiveness.

                            Unlike in Brazil, roads in Peru have barely made
                            their way into the Amazon lowlands, but they are
                            beginning to encroach.

                            There are some departmental roads, but they are
                            rare. Loreto, roughly the size of Guatemala,
                            Nicaragua and Honduras combined, has only two
                            asphalted roads (~200 km) (Arima 2016), and Iquitos
                            is the largest city in the world without a national
                            road connection.

                            frontier regions by improving market access,
                            creating jobs, raising incomes, and building of

                            Historically, however, roads in tropical forests
                            have also led to deforestation, and often brought
                            crime, dispossession, and marginalization. Arguably,

                            Although we travelled by river, roads still emerged
                            as an important theme in our journey. Between
                            Contamana and Dos de Mayo there are two overland
                            passages (varaderos) that have served as trading
                            routes between the Andes and the Amazon since Incan
                            times (Raimondi 1859; Coomes et al. 2020) and
                            according to local residents, today traffickers use
                            them to transport drugs from the Huallaga, through
                            the Ucayali and into Brazil. The strategic
                            importance of the area led the Franciscans to
                            establish a Mission at Sarayacu in the 19th century,
                            where they congregated indigenous peoples (Myers
                            1990). Ironically, Sarayacu today is a community
                            where traffickers gather to drink, and as we found
                            out, strangers are not welcome.

                            A couple of dirt roads, presumably built by loggers,
                            are already creeping westwards behind Orellana and
                            Tierra Blanca, seeking to connect the Ucayali with
                            towns on the Huallaga River (Finer and Novoa 2015).
                            The road from Tierra Blanca runs parallel to one of
                            the old varaderos, the journey taking three hours by
                            motorcycle (Figure 10) (La Región 2016); the other,
                            has been included in the road plans by the Ministry
                            of Transportation and Communications and was
                            declared of public interest by the Transport
                            Commission of the Peruvian Congress in 2017 (MTC
                            2005; Proyecto de Ley 203-2016). Informal reports
                            suggest that a larger network of roads exists, which
                            connects to the Huallaga from various communities
                            along a 180 km stretch between Tiruntán and Dos de
                            Mayo on the Ucayali (M. Pinedo-Vasquez pers comm).
                            With roads often come colonists, but we were not
                            expecting that the first people we would see as we
                            arrived at Tierra Blanca would be a group of
                            Mennonites – until recently, Mennonites had not yet
                            reached Peru. They were standing by the river's
                            edge, waiting for a lancha, while everyone else was
                            gathering at a couple of stores to watch Peru's
                            first match in a World Cup in 36 years. The two
                            Mennonite men we talked with explained that they had
                            recently left Bolivia due to problems with Evo
                            Morales' government and land scarcity; another group
                            had migrated from Belize. They originally settled
                            along the Pachitea River, near La Honoria in 2015
                            but were flooded out. They established three
                            Mennonite colonies, Österreich, Vanderland and
                            Providencia (roughly 500 people), inland from Tierra
                            Blanca. When we asked the Mennonite men if they felt
                            soils there were good for agriculture, they
                            confidently replied that they had been raised in the
                            jungle and knew how to work the land. Standing
                            beside a pile of new tin sheets for the roof of
                            their houses, they informed us that they were
                            producing typical Amazonian crops (plantains, yuca
                            and maize) but were planning to grow sesame and soy.
                            We could not help but to wonder if the presence of
                            the Mennonites in Peru will lead to large-scale
                            deforestation from mechanized commercial
                            agriculture, as in other parts of Latin America
                            (Hecht 2005; Ellis et al. 2017; le Polain de Waroux
                            et al. 2017; 2020). Recent reports indicate that the
                            Mennonites in these colonies are rapidly clearing
                            land, even in the context of COVID-19 (Finer et al.
                            2020), and that more families are planning to
                            migrate from Mennonite colonies in Belize (van der
                            Ende 2019; Anabaptist World 2020). In 2019, this
                            region was identified as a hotspot of deforestation
                            in Amazonia (Finer and Mamani 2020).

                            Upriver from Orellana, we stopped at a logging camp
                            on the right bank of the Ucayali. There were barges
                            loaded with logs and heavy machinery, in what seemed
                            to be a permanent post (Figure 11). Multiple wooden
                            buildings with cement floors served as living
                            quarters, a large dining room and working space.

                            Women washing large pots greeted us as we walked by.
                            Carlos, our guide, had suggested we stop there to
                            see the post and to visit Isla Baños, a small
                            community that is located 3 km inland along a road
                            built by a Pucallpa logging company that runs the
                            post. People from Isla Baños told us the road
                            extends about 100 km to the east, where the company
                            was logging. According to them, trucks hauled out
                            logs, day and night, and the volume of timber at the
                            site pointed to much activity. Although dusty, the
                            road was in perfect condition, an investment
                            indicative of the value of the resource being
                            extracted. The road was not quite as long as people
                            suggested, but it can easily be spotted on Google
                            Earth, reaching eastwards almost halfway to the
                            Tapiche River. What is most striking from the
                            satellite imagery is how quickly the road has
                            advanced, knowing that all valuable timber species
                            are being stripped out (Figure 12). The Sierra del
                            Divisor National Park lies only a few kilometers
                            further east.

                            In various places along the lower Ucayali we
                            encountered a different type of roads that connect
                            inland communities with those at the river's edge.
                            These rural roads are generally only a few
                            kilometers long but bring tremendous benefits to
                            people living in floodplain communities. One good
                            example is the short road from Dos de Mayo — an old
                            community that used to be at the edge of the Ucayali
                            but was left stranded when the river migrated — to
                            San Cristobal, located on the riverbank (Figure 13).
                            The road, which is paved and wide enough for two
                            rickshaws (motokars), provides a lifeline for
                            Dosdemayinos and facilitates inter-community
                            interactions. Unlike other roads, these roads are
                            built not to extract resources but to connect
                            people.

                            Floods are fundamental to life along the Amazon
                            River. They replenish soils, are key for fisheries
                            and facilitate transportation. For locals, floods
                            are a given, and in general they are well adapted to
                            them. Yet, floods can create significant challenges
                            for people, especially if flood events are long,
                            high, or come early (Langill and Abizaid 2020) or
                            when sudden flood reversals (repiquetes) occur
                            during the recession period (Coomes et al. 2016).
                            Periodically, severe floods destroy crops, kill
                            livestock, cause disease, food and income shortages,
                            and disrupt social life (Denevan 1996; Harris 1998;
                            Coomes 2010; Sherman et al. 2016; Langill and

                            Climate change models predict higher and longer
                            floods in western Amazonia (Sorribas et al. 2016;
                            Ronchail et al. 2018) and with settlements
                            concentrated along rivers, people in the Peruvian
                            Amazon are likely to be among the first and hardest
                            hit. How will they fare? Severe floods have been
                            reported to occur every 3-to-6 years near Pucallpa
                            (Langill and Abizaid 2020) and 2011 and 2014 were
                            record-height floods (Figure 14); the risk of
                            repiquetes affecting rice grown on mudflats is very
                            high (60-70%), with average loss of 40% of the crop
                            (List and Coomes 2017). A significant repiquete
                            occurred just days before our trip (a 2.65 m spike
                            in 48 hours; the typical annual flood amplitude is
                            about 10 m) (DRAU, 2018). We stopped at a large
                            mudflat planted with rice at Las Brisas, a left-bank
                            community about 1.5 hours upstream from Contamana.
                            The rice in the higher areas was amongst the lushest
                            we have ever seen, but it was evident that the lower
                            sections, closer to the river, had been severely
                            damaged (Figure 15). A local farmer contemplating
                            his loss said he was unsure if he would replant
                            rice, or grow cowpeas instead, but he knew he had to
                            plant again soon if he was to harvest before the
                            next flood. Time will tell if mudflat rice will
                            continue to be viable in the future.

                            Despite intensified flooding, it is not always
                            practical for people to resettle on higher ground,
                            because of difficulties in access. Instead, people
                            in many communities are raising their houses on
                            higher stilts to ensure they stay above the flood.
                            We saw houses standing on stilts up to 8 feet tall
                            in places like Tacshitea and Huarmi Isla I(Figure
                            16), close to the mouth of the Callería and the
                            Puinahua canal, respectively. Interestingly, in some
                            places, people reported that nearby upland (terra
                            firme) areas, which should not flood according to
                            local floklore, are inundating. Although it remains
                            unclear whether this is a recent phenomenon, what
                            stemmed from conversations with local residents was
                            that not all flooding is derived from turbid waters
                            spilling over the riverbanks and that in some
                            communities flooding is caused by the rise of the
                            water table above ground surface in lower areas of
                            the terra firme. This type of local flooding along
                            whitewater rivers has yet to be studied but is
                            likely to have important implications for soil
                            fertility, human health, and ultimately it may
                            challenge the upland-floodplain distinction that
                            still dominates local folklore and academic
                            discourse.

                            In response to severe floods in the last decade,
                            district governments along the lower Ucayali have
                            put hefty amounts of money to build flood protection
                            walls around communities that may also serve as
                            causeways during the high water (Figure 17). In
                            Manco Capac alone, close to $300,000 were spent in
                            2017, mostly in wages to residents, but we saw such
                            structures in several towns and communities in the
                            lower reaches of the Ucayali. These walls have yet
                            to be put to the test with a high flood, but their
                            effectiveness at protecting communities from the
                            water rising is questionable and thus may be giving
                            people a false sense of security. It is possible
                            that this initiative was geared at creating jobs,
                            especially in leading up to an election year, rather
                            than to protect people from floods.

                            A striking trend we observed on this trip is the
                            recent and widespread adoption of small motors and
                            cell phones, which are changing life in the region.
                            Small motors have been used as boat engines and in
                            chainsaws at least since the 1960s, but only the
                            wealthiest people could afford them, using them to
                            run a colectivo, to fish, or for logging (Bergman
                            1980; Hiraoka 1985). The motors we found on our trip
                            are as low-tech as those from the 1960s, but as a
                            result of the 2010 China-Peru Free Trade Agreement,
                            which removed tariffs on imports of small motors and
                            motorized equipment, Peru has been flooded with very
                            affordable small motors. A 5.5 hp peque-peque engine
                            can be purchased new in Pucallpa for as little as
                            $100, and less if second-hand; about one-fifth of
                            the cost of a motor in the early 2000s (Figure 18).
                            According to residents from a community close to
                            Pucallpa, it is possible to earn enough money to buy
                            a peque-peque from one or two good nights of
                            fishing, or from profits from a good harvest.
                            Another significant advantage of these motors is
                            that they can be repaired with simple tools and
                            limited mechanical knowledge. Beyond boats and
                            chainsaws, small motors are widely used today to
                            power motokars, cargo rickshaws (furgones), and
                            rudimentary wagons locally known as Kubotas,
                            portable sawmills, water pumps, weed-eaters,
                            threshers, generators, among other things that are
                            easing life for people (Figure 19). Even in small
                            communities everyone seemed to have a peque-peque,
                            something that was rare only 15 years ago; shop
                            owners carry stock of gasoline and replacement
                            parts, and some, as in San Cristobal, sold the
                            motors locally.

                            The implications of these changes for livelihoods
                            and resource conservation are profound. People
                            commented that a peque-peque allows them to tend
                            fields and fish at more distant sites. Personal
                            boats have made it much easier to travel to visit
                            relatives and friends, to attend sports tournaments
                            in other communities (Walker 2013; Abizaid et al.
                            2018), and to transport more produce to and from the
                            market (Figure 20). Small motors are making some
                            agricultural tasks faster and less burdensome and
                            could change agricultural labor relations. In
                            several communities we saw men returning from the
                            fields, weed-eaters on their shoulder instead of a
                            machete. In conversation, it became clear that wage
                            labor arrangements were shifting from daily wages to
                            task-based work due to the increased labor
                            efficiency of weed-eaters (Figure 21). Besides
                            easing labor bottlenecks, this shift is translating
                            into higher earnings for some laborers. A man in
                            Tamanco mentioned that under this arrangement,
                            people can earn about 70 S/. in 5 hours, which is
                            more than double the daily wage. Higher wages could
                            create disincentives to participate in cooperative
                            labor parties (mingas) and community public works,
                            which are important to social life in rural Amazonia
                            (Hames 1987; Chibnik and de Jong 1987; Abizaid et
                            al. 2015). We were unable to confirm the situation
                            about mingas, but local residents did tell us that
                            people are more likely to participate in public
                            works such as the clearing of streets or weeding
                            around the school, because working with weeders is
                            faster and much less onerous than working with
                            machetes.

                            More broadly, small motors are creating new economic
                            opportunities for rural peoples, allowing them to
                            add value locally, provide new services, and run
                            different types of businesses. We saw, for instance,
                            a portable sawmill in Nuevo Canchahuaya and a group
                            of men using a chainsaw to build a boat in
                            <a class="location" data-layer-id="figure-22"
                                >Alto Perillo (Figure 22)</a
                            >. We consistently encountered motokars, furgones
                            and Kubotas transporting people or cargo in and
                            around communities. In Victoria there were two
                            sewing shops where women were making school uniforms
                            and soccer jerseys of the Peruvian National team as
                            part of the World Cup craze, using textiles brought
                            in from Lima. Clearly, this diversification has the
                            potential to exacerbate inequalities and social
                            differentiation. However, the affordability of the
                            smaller motors, especially peque-peques, also lowers
                            entry barriers for participation in some activities.
                            For instance, with a small peque-peque anyone can
                            run a boat taxi (llevo-llevo) (Langill 2020), and in
                            combination with an old fridge and ice, fishermen
                            can preserve their fish longer and take their catch
                            directly to market for sale (<a

                            Like motors, cell phones have gained much popularity
                            in the Peruvian Amazon, despite lagging coverage
                            relative to other regions of Peru. Over the last few
                            years and as part of an agreement with the Peruvian
                            Government, Telefónica del Peru has established a
                            network of small antennae in selected rural
                            communities that have been a game changer for rural
                            populations along the middle and lower Ucayali in
                            general (Andina 2016). Cell phones have provided
                            valuable communication during the COVID-19 pandemic;
                            with rural (fixed) phones inactive since 2019, cell
                            phones have been the primary source of communication
                            during the current pandemic (Takasaki et al. 2021).
                            Claro, a subsidiary of Carlos Slim's TelMex and the
                            second main carrier in Peru, tends to focus on urban
                            coverage. It was interesting to find that cell phone
                            access was ubiquitous, and that young people are
                            just as obsessed with cell phones as those in Lima
                            or North America. Locals use phones to talk with
                            relatives and friends and some are quite active in
                            social media, but most importantly for our work, we
                            found that people of the Ucayali are also using cell
                            phones to get market and price information, to
                            connect with buyers in market towns and to
                            coordinate transportation services. For example, at
                            a community near the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve
                            (PSNR), a local shop owner was not shy to ask if we
                            were interested in buying turtle eggs, a sale that
                            would be illegal. He said he could get them for us
                            once the turtles laid their eggs and could give a
                            buzz over a cell phone to coordinate the shipment
                            and payment. Similarly, a local informal lender
                            (habilitador) for fish in the same community told us
                            that thanks to her cell phone, she has been able to
                            bypass intermediaries in the city and is now selling
                            fish directly through a relative based in Pucallpa.

                            But most striking for us was to find an emergent
                            money transfer scheme linked to cell phones. In a
                            region where cash is scarce, it seemed unimaginable
                            that we would encounter ads posted outside of
                            stores, offering quick, safe and reliable money
                            transfers within Loreto, Ucayali and San Martín, as
                            we walked the streets in small towns such as
                            Bretaña, Juancito, San Roque and Victoria, among
                            others (<a
                                class="location"

                            >). At least five companies were offering such
                            services, one of them covering more than 40
                            communities and towns in Loreto alone. We learnt
                            about how the service works from Don José
                            (pseudonym), a local contact in Bretaña, close to
                            the PSNR and the site of a recent violent
                            confrontation with police forces after the
                            occupation of an oil facility by local indigenous
                            peoples (Fernández Calvo 2020). According to Don
                            José, someone wishing to send money would come to
                            him with the desired amount to transfer and the name
                            and location of the receiver. He would then contact
                            a partner merchant in the destination community (or
                            a central office) using his cell phone, with the
                            instruction to pay out the money to that person al
                            toque (on the spot), charging 10 S/. ($4) for
                            transfers of up to 1000 S/. ($400). Like Western
                            Union, this type of service is likely important for
                            transferring remittances but given its less formal
                            nature there is concern that it could be used for
                            money laundering and to finance illegal activities.
                            Based on our conversations with locals, we think
                            habilitadores in the city may use these
                            cellphone-based money transfers to finance
                            extractive activities by rural households at scales
                            unseen before.

                            to talk to the fishing party. They were from Nueva
                            York— not the Big Apple, but a small community along
                            the Tapiche River—and were on an expedition to chase
                            schools of migrating fish (mijanos) on the Ucayali
                            as water levels drop. Backing a sign that said in
                            Spanish “Welcome to the New World” and equipped with
                            food for about a month, fishing supplies (boats,
                            nets, gasoline, ice, salt and old fridges as ice
                            boxes), these fishermen told us they were waiting
                            for the fish to leave three nearby oxbow lakes and,
                            armed with gill nets of different sizes, they hoped
                            to catch about 10 tonnes of fish in just days
                            (Figure 25). We did not have an opportunity to ask
                            them about how they procured their supplies, but it
                            is not difficult to envision how money transfer
                            services through cell phones could be mobilized to
                            finance ventures like this or even larger ones. Back
                            in Bretaña, Belisario (pseudonym), who drove us
                            around in his motokar, explained that on the side,
                            he buys fish to freeze and send to the city. He
                            coordinates in advance with a stable pool of clients
                            who transfer him the money once the fish have been
                            sold. Cell phones are reducing the cost of
                            transactions and are changing lives along the river
                            in significant ways.

                        <p>
                            Peru holds the second largest area of the Amazon
                            basin, yet it is far less well known than the
                            Brazilian Amazon. Our 1000 km boat journey down the
                            Ucayali opened our eyes to important changes
                            underway in the Peruvian Amazon. Changes in river
                            transport mobility, new roads, hydrological changes
                            due to climate change, and the arrival of small
                            motors and cell phones are rapidly changing the
                            environment and lives and lifeways of the people who
                            live along one of the largest tributaries of the
                            Amazon River. Our observations and conversations
                            with people as we travelled down the Ucayali on the
                            Carlitos suggest that the Ucayali River is shaping
                            up as one of the most dynamic frontiers in Amazonia,
                            especially along the west bank of the Ucayali, as a
                            key region for Andes-Amazon integration. Although
                            the changes we report on in this article are
                            important individually, their combined synergistic
                            effects will be greater. Although the Peruvian
                            Amazon remains still largely undeveloped, our
                            findings from this boat trip provide a glimpse into
                            greater changes to come to the region and lend
                            support to concerns that change in western Amazonia
                            may follow in the footsteps of Brazil. How will the
                            environment and the people of the Ucayali and the
                            Peruvian Amazon fare in the coming years remains to
                            be discovered.

                            We are grateful to Carlos Rengifo (our guide) and
                            Orison Tapayuri (boat pilot) without whom the trip
                            would have not been possible. We are most thankful
                            to all the people of the Ucayali we encountered
                            along the journey for their warmth and generosity;
                            they made the trip so much more interesting and
                            enjoyable. The map was prepared by Julia Daley and
                            Helen Turvene. An earlier version of this article
                            was presented at the 2020 Meeting of the Conference

                            reviewers for their thoughtful comments which helped
                            us to improve this article. The trip was supported
