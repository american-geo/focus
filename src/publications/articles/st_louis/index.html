                <p class="start">Sports landscapes are playing an increasing role in urban development in the United
                    States, remaking central cities as economic activities like manufacturing have declined in recent
                    decades. Since the early 1990s, a stadium building boom has reconstructed urban environments to
                    emphasize tourism and entertainment. New sports facilities have contributed to filling a
                    post-industrial economic void, modifying city skylines and promoting positive urban identities. In
                    general, political leaders and urban planners across the United States hope to (re-)create dense,
                    walkable cities that are home to unique neighborhoods full of independent stores and unique
                    restaurants. They argue that new sport-anchored developments can transform and revitalize their host
                    community (Austrian and Rosentraub 2002; Turner 2002; Turner and Rosentraub 2002; Friedman et al.
                    2004; Hall 2004; Silk 2004; Duquette and Mason 2008; Friedman 2010; Rosentraub 2014; Koch 2017;
                    Podair 2017; Friedman 2018).</p>
                <p>Only infrequently have geographers attempted to interpret sports landscapes. As geographer Peirce
                    Lewis observed, “we need to know much more about the way that Americans have subdivided and
                    allocated geographic space for recreation and games” (1983, 255; see also Bale 1988). However,
                    because they are recognizable landmarks full of cultural meaning, sports stadiums have recently
                    become the focus of geographic study. For many urban residents, stadiums are sources “of civic pride
                    and a symbol of victory and accomplishment” (Raitz 1995, 5). Others have compared stadiums to
                    cathedrals (Novak 1976; John 2002; Trumpbour 2007) as well as to Greek agoras and Roman forums
                    (Jackson 1984), gathering places that foster place-making and help form the collective cultural
                    identity of a city (Bale 1988; Gaffney 2008; Gumprecht 2008; Zelinsky 2011; Gaffney 2014).</p>
                <p>Stadiums are not isolated, stand-alone facilities of course. At their best, sports infrastructure can
                    connect to their surroundings, enhancing the sense of place and boosting the economy of their host
                    city through sports-related entertainment. Scholars have assessed baseball stadiums, in particular,
                    for their place-shaping abilities. Recent studies have argued that Wrigley Field in Chicago
                    (Gripshover 2008), Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles (Podair 2017), and Busch Stadium III in St. Louis
                    (Hurt 2018) have altered their adjacent neighborhoods, shaped new images of their host cities, and
                    potentially benefited the public since games offer opportunities for unifying social experiences. As
                    architecture critic Paul Goldberger argued, stadiums are significant public spaces and “the ballpark
                    is one of the greatest of all American building types, as it reveals as much about how we treat our
                    cities today as it ever has in the past” (2019, x).</p>
                <p>In many ways, St. Louis, Missouri, is a quintessential Rust Belt city. Through the first half of the
                    1900s, readily available manufacturing jobs attracted immigrants from Europe as well as
                    rural-to-urban migrants from Missouri and the Mississippi River Valley (Primm 1998; Sandweiss 2001).
                    But by the 1950s, increasing disinvestment, a declining corporate and personal tax base,
                    intensifying racial segregation, as well as the depopulation of the City of St. Louis led to the
                    national perception of pervasive urban decay (Bradley 2013; Gordon 2014; O’Neil 2014). Since then,
                    city leaders have attempted to reimagine downtown on several occasions in order to reverse the now
                    70-year long trend of economic and population decline (Sandweiss 2001; Laslo et al. 2003; Gordon
                    2008; Gordon 2014). Although the specific plans have changed over time, typically planners propose
                    enhancing transportation connections to the suburbs, increasing the number of white-collar jobs, as
                    well as encouraging suburban residents to return to the city for entertainment, sports, and other
                    consumptive activities (Cowan 2005; O’Neil 2013a).</p>

                    sports stadiums comprise the core of the region. Map by author.</div>
                <p>In St. Louis, use of sports infrastructure to modify the city’s urban landscape has intensified since
                    the early 1990s, shaping an evolving sports entertainment district (Figure 1). In 1994, the
                    Enterprise Center (formerly the Kiel Center, Savvis Center, and Scottrade Center) opened as the new
                    home for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL) (Figure 2). The next year, The Dome
                    at America’s Center (formerly the Trans World Dome and Edward Jones Dome) was completed (Figure 3).
                    It was constructed as part of the plan to attract a National Football League (NFL) team to St.
                    Louis. In 2006, Major League Baseball’s (MLB) St. Louis Cardinals moved into retro-style Busch
                    Stadium III (Figure 4). As part of that project, the Cardinals developed adjoining Ballpark Village,
                    a sports-themed entertainment district. The current project altering the St. Louis landscape is
                    construction of a stadium for a Major League Soccer (MLS) team (Figure 5).</p>

                <p>Supporters argue that the stadium building boom has enhanced the urban landscape of St. Louis,
                    forming an L-shaped sports and sports entertainment region from the Dome southward to Busch Stadium
                    before turning west to Enterprise Center and ending at Union Station and the MLS stadium complex.
                    Although this region is currently in formation, the St. Louis Sports Entertainment District is
                    currently shaping the landscape of St. Louis. Four sports facilities comprise the core of the region
                    (see Meinig 1965 for his core-domain-sphere model). They are surrounded by an irregularly shaped
                    sports entertainment domain of businesses (including bars, restaurants, and hotels) that directly
                    benefit from sports events as well as parking lots and structures that provide necessary
                    infrastructure on game days. Adjacent to the core and domain areas, a variety of other (non-sports)
                    urban land uses is typical. Government buildings, a large transect of railroad lines to the south,
                    corporate headquarters, gentrified housing, businesses that do not specifically cater to a sports
                    clientele, and non-sports tourism (including the Gateway Arch grounds) surround the St. Louis Sports
                    Entertainment District.</p>
                <p>In order to better understand the making of this region, I sought to interpret the historical
                    evolution of the four current St. Louis sports facilities. My site visits to the area began in 2006,
                    on both game and non-game days. I looked for visible urban patterns and the flow of fans (both in
                    transit to the region and on foot) on MLB, NHL, and NFL gamedays. Field work was supplemented by
                    interpreting textual information found in the media, historic photographs and postcards, government
                    reports and planning documents, as well as a synthesis of secondary source material.</p>

                <h3>Enterprise Center (1994-present)</h3>
                <p>Professional hockey in St. Louis was first played in the St. Louis Arena, a large multi-purpose
                    facility that opened in 1929 (Figure 6). Once St. Louis was awarded an NHL expansion franchise and
                    the Blues began play in 1967, the Arena (also known as the Checkerdome) hosted games, as well as
                    other events including conventions and concerts (Ballparks.com 2018; St. Louis Post-Dispatch 2019).
                    The cavernous building closed in 1994 and due to a non-compete clause in the financing agreement of
                    the newly-constructed Enterprise Center, the Arena remained vacant for several years (Ballparks.com
                    2018; St. Louis Post-Dispatch 2019). After the City of St. Louis demolished the Arena in 1999, the
                    large empty lot was redeveloped by private interests into The Highlands, a business and residential
                    mixed-use development featuring loft-style apartments, a Hampton Inn, radio station headquarters,
                    and various businesses (St. Louis Post-Dispatch 2019) (Figure 7).</p>

                <p> The Enterprise Center opened in 1994 and is a 12-story glass and concrete building with 18,000 seats
                    in the Downtown West neighborhood (Figure 8). With assistance from tax-exempt financing (more than
                    $62 million out of a total cost of $170 million), a group of local corporate leaders contributed
                    private funding to construct the facility near Union Station (a historic train station renovated
                    into an entertainment destination) (Miller 2002; Laslo 2003; Faulk and Addo 2017; Enterprise Center
                    2019). Although the City of St. Louis owns the Enterprise Center, the St. Louis Blues operate and
                    manage the building. The arena characteristically hosts about 175 sporting and non-sports events
                    (including college basketball tournaments and numerous concerts) attracting almost 2 million people
                    to the facility each year (Enterprise Center 2019). During the 2019-2020 season, 35 Blues home games
                    drew approximately 18,000 fans per game, for a yearly total of 633,000 (Hockey Reference 2020).</p>

                <p>In 2017, a three-year, $150 million renovation of the Enterprise Center began in order to modernize a
                    facility that civic leaders and team officials argued was obsolete when compared to other arenas in
                    the Midwest (Durando 2017; Faulk and Addo 2017; Enterprise Center 2019). Phase one included
                    infrastructure upgrades including heating and cooling, improved lighting, renovations to the ice
                    plant, replacement of some lower-tier seating, and a new high-definition video board (Rubbelke 2018)
                    (Figure 9). Phase two focused on increasing fan amenities including new premium seating and
                    entertainment areas, a beer garden, plus a significant expansion to the team store. Upper-tier seats
                    were also replaced (Rubbelke 2018; Kelly 2019). Finally, phase three replaced the remaining original
                    seats, remodeled fan gathering spaces, and upgraded the kids’ zone (Kelly 2019).</p>

                <p>When the Enterprise Center was completed, it was part of a hockey arena building boom (Sports
                    Business Journal 2017). With these arenas now reaching advanced age (for a sports facility), team
                    owners are requesting publicly-funded upgrades to infrastructure and new fan experience amenities
                    (such as private boxes, all-inclusive areas, expanded shopping and dining choices, and designated
                    zones for children). Arguments for economic viability are typically coupled with calls to enhance
                    the place-making ability of sport structures as increasingly fans want to watch a game accompanied
                    by an amenity-laden experience involving food, shopping, and sport. In St. Louis, team officials
                    argue that renovations to the Enterprise Center will make the building the “town hall of St. Louis,”
                    serving as an urban landmark and community gathering place that reflects unique regional
                    characteristics (Kelly 2019). Coupled with the recent success of the Blues and their booming
                    attendance, the renovated Enterprise Center and Union Station in Downtown West are gaining momentum
                    as sports-entertainment destinations, enhancing the western core of the St. Louis Sports
                    Entertainment District.</p>

                <h3>The Dome at America’s Center (1995-present)</h3>
                <p> Situated at the northern edge of the Central Business District, the Dome at America’s Center is
                    connected to the city’s convention center (America’s Center, built in 1977) (Figure 10). America’s
                    Center is owned by the City of St. Louis while the Dome is owned jointly by the city, county, and
                    State of Missouri (Faulk and Addo 2017). The Dome is an expansive indoor multi-purpose space that
                    hosts concerts and conventions in addition to sporting events. Best known as the NFL’s St. Louis
                    Rams’ home from 1995 to 2015, its 66,000 seats include 120 luxury suites as well as a private club
                    seat level (Stadiums of Pro Football 2019). During their last year in St. Louis (2015), the Rams
                    averaged more than 52,000 fans per home game, a yearly attendance of approximately 420,000 (Pro
                    Football Reference 2015). Due to the ample space required for a football field and a large seating
                    capacity, the Dome’s footprint is sizable and the sheer extent of the facility makes for an awkward
                    relationship with the surrounding region.</p>

                    city. Photo by author, 2019.</div>
                <p> Built for $280 million (all publicly funded) as part of the plan to recruit an expansion or existing
                    NFL team and to counter the perception of St. Louis as a second-tier sports city, at the time of its
                    construction the Dome was promoted as a state-of-the-art facility, and its combination of renovated
                    convention center and domed stadium “were considered leading models of a contemporary multipurpose
                    structure” (Laslo 2003, 1080; see also Miller 2002; Click 2016-2017; Stadiums of Pro Football 2019).
                    Renovations completed in 2009 replaced the video display boards and expanded premium seating areas
                    (Click 2016-2017). Additional amenities and new field turf were added in following years (Figure
                    11). Still, media and fan reports widely characterized the Dome as a poor place to watch football
                    offering a limited number of fan experiences in a lifeless atmosphere that contradicted the
                    festival-type spectacle that ticketholders expect during gamedays (Rooney and Davidson 1995).</p>

                <p>City officials increasingly became concerned about their lease with the Rams. Under the 1995
                    agreement, the Dome had to remain in the top quarter of NFL stadiums (measured at 10-year intervals)
                    in terms of fan amenities and stadium infrastructure. If the Dome was not ranked as one of the top
                    eight stadiums in the NFL, the Rams could break the lease and relocate (Click 2016-2017; Hunn 2019;
                    Stadiums of Pro Football 2019). When the Dome fell below the top quarter of NFL stadiums in 2005 and
                    2015 and team officials and government representatives could not agree upon needed renovations, the
                    Rams terminated their lease and moved to Los Angeles after the 2015 season ended (Click 2016-2017;
                    Hunn 2019). Without professional football the Dome continued to be utilized for conventions,
                    concerts, and a variety of sporting events.</p>
                <p>According to tourism advocates, America’s Center and the Dome need approximately $350 million in
                    renovations (Faulk and Addo 2017). Leaders claim that St. Louis no longer attracts competitive bids
                    for large conventions, since rival cities including Nashville and Indianapolis have recently
                    invested millions in upgrading their facilities (Barker 2018a; Bott 2018; Lloyd 2019). In 2019, the
                    city and county agreed to fund $175 million of improvements to the Dome, adding exhibit space,
                    meeting areas, loading dock access, and creating a green space for outdoor events (Bott 2018; Lloyd
                    2019). During their campaign to secure funding, officials argued that America’s Center is “the front
                    door for St. Louis,” the initial point of contact for many first-time visitors to the city (Lloyd
                    2019). Still, its long-term impact on the sports landscape is questionable due to the lack of an NFL
                    team, a decreasing number of conventions (even prior to COVID-19), and the imposing design of the
                    structure which acts as a monolithic concrete island surrounded by few businesses serving game day
                    customers. Although the Dome is a core facility in the St. Louis Sports Entertainment District, it
                    is a prime example of poor design impacting place-making abilities. Closed-off from the adjacent
                    city, lacking commercial options at street level, the underused Dome at America’s Center makes a
                    limited contribution to enhancing sense of place in St. Louis.</p>

                <h3>Busch Stadium III (2006-present)</h3>
                <p>Of the recent sport-related projects, the city’s baseball stadium and Ballpark Village have been the
                    most successful at altering the urban landscape of St. Louis. The current baseball stadium, Busch
                    Stadium III, replaced (not surprisingly) Busch Stadium II, built in 1966. A multi-sport structure,
                    Busch Stadium II was promoted by city officials as an urban renewal project intended to revive the
                    southern Central Business District (City Plan Commission 1960; Primm 1998; Sandweiss 2001; Laslo
                    2003; Gordon 2008; Bradley 2013; O’Neil 2013; Hurt 2018) (Figure 12). Although the stadium was
                    functional for 40 years, it was an excellent example of a placeless late-modern era baseball stadium
                    designed for mass audiences, constructed outside of existing neighborhoods, and visually closed to
                    the surrounding city (Neilson 1986, 1995; Pastier 1995; Fairfield 2001; Ritzer and Stillman 2001;
                    Cowan 2005; Cowan 2016; Goldberger 2019). Worse, Busch Stadium II did little to reverse the economic
                    decline of downtown St. Louis (Sandweiss 2001; Laslo et al. 2003; Gordon 2014).</p>

                <p>Encouraging functional neighborhoods, employment stability, and vibrant downtown mixed-use districts
                    became part of a larger campaign to project new, positive images of St. Louis. City leaders again
                    used sport to fuel this effort. The current, retro-style $411 million baseball stadium was designed
                    by noted sports architects Populous (formerly HOK Sport) and opened in 2006. Busch Stadium III was
                    mostly privately financed (nearly 80 percent), although the project received multiple real estate
                    tax abatements, other tax waivers, as well as government assistance with infrastructure costs (Hunn
                    2010; Click 2014). The baseball-only ballpark features a natural grass field, has more than 44,000
                    seats, and was designed with an outfield that opens to the city (providing memorable views of
                    downtown and the Gateway Arch) (Figure 13). The traditional red brick construction and use of other
                    historical architectural details including repeating arches (referencing both the Gateway Arch and
                    the wrought iron spans on the nearby Eads Bridge) reinforce the enhanced sense of place created by
                    the ballpark—fans attending games are constantly reminded that they are in St. Louis. Busch Stadium
                    III has been a popular destination with a 2019 season average of more than 42,000 fans per game, a

                <p>Architects modeled Busch Stadium III after Baltimore’s Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Cleveland’s
                    Progressive Field in the Gateway District, retro-designed baseball stadiums surrounded by
                    revitalized central city regions focused on sport, tourism, and entertainment. Baseball-only
                    stadiums with natural grass fields, unique architectural details, downtown locations, and a design
                    open to the city characterizes these ballparks that attempt to link with the urban histories around
                    them (Neilson 1995; Ritzer and Stillman 2001; Chapin 2004; Ponder 2004; Rosensweig 2005; Goldberger
                    2019). Increasingly, retro stadiums combine a safe leisure experience for fans with enhanced
                    revenue-generating streams for team owners. Luxury boxes, restricted all-inclusive areas, as well as
                    opportunities for consumption inside the ballpark including shopping, fine dining in luxury boxes,
                    and play space for children are enclosed by a stadium that looks historic (Pastier 1995; Fairfield
                    2001; Ritzer and Stillman 2001; Rosensweig 2005; Gordon 2013).</p>
                <p>The agreement that provided limited public funding for Busch Stadium III mandated that the Cardinals
                    create Ballpark Village, an entertainment district and neighborhood situated on a 10-acre site
                    immediately north of the stadium (Figure 14). Original proposals by the Cardinals called for a
                    two-phase project, with commercial space scheduled to open in 2007 and the entire $650 million
                    development completed by 2011 (Ponder 2004; Crisp 2012; Click 2014; Bryant 2016). However, the
                    beginning of the Great Recession in 2007 delayed the project and the property unbecomingly housed a
                    dirt pit, then a softball field, and finally large parking lots (Figure 15).</p>

                <p>The Cardinals and their development partner (Cordish Companies) revised the original Ballpark Village
                    plans, broke ground in 2013, and completed phase one, a $100 million, two city block area devoted to
                    sports-related entertainment, in 2014 (Logan 2013) (Figure 16). The team promoted the destination as
                    the first sports-focused entertainment district in the United States (Goldberger 2019). The 100,000
                    square foot space featured abundant consumption options with Fox Sports Midwest Live! (a large
                    restaurant with an enormous 35-foot wide television), a three-story Budweiser Brew House, Cardinals
                    Nation (home to a team museum and rooftop seats looking into the stadium), and a live event plaza
                    anchoring the space (Hartwig 2014) (Figure 17). Ballpark Village quickly proved to be popular
                    destination even on non-game days with nearly 7 million visitors in 2015, giving the Cardinals a new
                    revenue stream to complement ticket sales and concessions at Busch Stadium III (Bryant 2015).</p>

                <p>After a multi-year lull, phase two of the Ballpark Village project began in 2017 (Figure 18). This
                    $260 million project (with at least $65 million in public subsidies) emphasized mixed-use
                    development along Clark Street (Ballpark Village 2017a; Ballpark Village 2017; Barker 2017a; Brown
                    and Barker 2017). New Urbanist design was applied to office space, a 29-story amenity-laden
                    residential tower with more than 300 units, an eight-story luxury hotel, and retail space that
                    replaced surface parking (Figure 19). Completed in 2020, the Cardinals hope to generate a
                    pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use “dynamic, vibrant, 24/7 neighborhood” that complements fan amenities
                    at Busch Stadium III (Barker 2017b, p. B1; see also Barker 2017c; Ballpark Village 2017; Brown and
                    Barker 2017; Ballpark Village 2019). Creating a functional neighborhood with a sense of community is
                    the team’s primary goal (Barker 2017c, Barker 2019a).</p>

                    function as a village—a neighborhood with spaces to work, to live, and to be entertained in close
                    proximity. Photo by author, 2020.</div>
                <p>The Cardinals have tentatively indicated that a future stage is possible, with planning beginning as
                    early as 2022 (Kukuljan 2021). This third phase will potentially include three office buildings
                    along Walnut Street on the remaining open space, with the goal of creating a corporate campus for a
                    company willing to relocate to downtown St. Louis (Bryant 2016; Barker 2017a; Barker 2017c; Brown
                    and Barker 2017). Expanding potential revenue streams from Ballpark Village will increase income for
                    Cardinals owners as well as allow for greater control over the space surrounding the ballpark.
                    Sports studies author Michael Friedman calls the places created by blending revenue-generation
                    opportunities and sport, mallparks (2018). Designed to be a combination of a ballpark, shopping
                    mall, and theme park, mallparks represent a new type of urban place in and around stadiums that
                    maximizes the economic activity of sports fans and promotes positive images of the host city
                    (Friedman 2018). </p>
                <p> The (re-)transformation of the southern urban core is, to this point, the most successful
                    sport-related component reshaping the urban landscape of St. Louis (Figure 20). Numerous home
                    baseball games (81) and a long season (six months) provide many opportunities for fans to frequent
                    nearby shops and restaurants. In addition to constructing new landmarks, the current Busch Stadium
                    and Ballpark Village project overtly seeks to shape a new, post-industrial image of St. Louis as a
                    revitalized city and regional tourist and entertainment destination.</p>

                <h3>MLS Stadium (completion estimated 2022)</h3>
                <p>The most recent attempt to use sport to re-energize St. Louis is an ongoing campaign to receive a
                    Major League Soccer expansion franchise. This effort began in earnest in 2016 and started, stopped,
                    and restarted due to debate over public funding for the project. The ownership group was awarded an
                    MLS franchise (St. Louis City SC) in 2019 and is building a privately-financed stadium west of Union
                    Station (Barker 2018b; Rishe 2018; Barker and Frederickson 2019) (Figure 21). The investors plan to
                    complete the $400 million, 22,500 seat, open-air, natural grass stadium in 2022 and participate in
                    the 2023 MLS season, although construction groundworks did not begin until early 2020 (Barker 2018b;
                    Frederickson 2019; Frederickson 2020a). The architectural design calls for the pitch to be located
                    below street level, surrounded by two decks of seats under a partial covering that will reduce the
                    impact of weather and increase crowd noise. The project contains minimal public funding, with more
                    than $5 million in state tax credits, a property tax abatement, and multiple special sales tax
                    districts (Barker 2019c; Barker and Frederickson 2019; Erickson 2020).</p>

                <div class="caption">Figure 21. Land west of Union Station will be the <a class="location" data-layer-id="figure21">site of the new MLS stadium</a>, team
                    offices, and practice facilities. The ownership group plans to complete the open-air stadium in
                    2022. Photo by author, 2020.</div>
                <p>The MLS project is furthering the national perception that St. Louis is “a traditional soccer market
                    with a downtown that’s on the rebound” (Straus 2019). Even though soccer stadiums have not
                    historically been prominent features on the American landscape, the unnamed St. Louis facility will
                    be an instant landmark and visible sign of urban vitality (Bowden 1995). City leaders and the
                    prospective ownership group hope that a new soccer stadium hosting 17 home games each year will
                    create entertainment synergy with adjacent Union Station and encourage new economic activity in the
                    neighborhood known as Downtown West. Historically, the development of Union Station area as an
                    economically sustainable tourist destination has been difficult, due in part to its separation from
                    the tourism-focused Central Business District (Cowan 2016). However, hoping to recapture tourism
                    relevancy, Union Station recently completed a $187 million rebranding with the addition of a large
                    aquarium and 200-foot observation (Ferris) wheel on site (Hahn 2019) (Figure 22).</p>

                <div class="caption">Figure 22. Team owners are constructing the new MLS stadium west of Union Station,
                    a former train station renovated into a shopping and entertainment destination. City leaders hope
                    increased visitation to Union Station coupled with home soccer games will draw new consumers to the
                    western end of the St. Louis Sports Entertainment District. Photo by author, 2019.</div>
                <p>With a new stadium and a reimagined Union Station, the MLS proposal advocated that the area will
                    “become a centerpiece of an energized downtown experience” (Frederickson 2019, p. D12; see also
                    Barker 2019c). Artistic renderings indicate space for restaurants and other commercial activities to
                    be included in the stadium project, in order to encourage year-round visitation to the area. A plaza
                    featuring a small soccer pitch will provide attractive outdoor space for public use, even on
                    non-game days (Barker and Frederickson 2019). Construction will add minimal parking, contributing to
                    the goal of encouraging a dense, urban landscape.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of the campaign to attract an MLS franchise to St. Louis, city leaders and
                    corporate proponents argued that constructing a soccer stadium district west of Union Station is
                    part of the larger effort to create a sports, culture, and entertainment corridor in downtown (Faulk
                    2016; Frederickson 2020a). This project pushes the region further west, connecting Downtown West to
                    sports facilities and sports-related entertainment in the Central Business District. However, team
                    owners hope that the soccer stadium project will transcend the St. Louis Sports Entertainment
                    District. They are advocating a more ambitious goal of using soccer (and the branding of St. Louis
                    City SC specifically) to reinterpret and redefine St. Louis as a city and region united by diverse
                    cultures, iconic neighborhoods, economic growth, and cultural renaissance (Frederickson 2020b).</p>

            <section id="6" class="scene" data-scene-id="place1" title="Implications">
                <h3>Implications</h3>
                <p>Increasingly, politicians, developers, and team officials are reallocating space to stadiums and
                    sports-related entertainment. New stadiums, proponents argue, will attract tourists, encourage new
                    businesses and jobs, expand the income base, and make central cities places to work and live once
                    again. This is particularly true in cities where teams are aggressively remaking the areas around
                    their stadiums, creating sports entertainment regions (or mallparks). In St. Louis, four stadium
                    projects built over the course of three decades have contributed to the formation of a St. Louis
                    Sports Entertainment District, an evolving area where sport and sports entertainment dominate the
                    economy.</p>
                <p>The momentum of sports-related construction development has encouraged one CEO to state that St.
                    Louis is “a city of the future,” with the potential to undergo sustained growth (Barker 2019b, p.
                    B6). Cardinals officials support this contention, arguing that Ballpark Village, coupled with the
                    newly renovated Gateway Arch grounds and ongoing tourism-focused rebranding at Union Station is
                    revitalizing downtown St. Louis (Brown and Barker 2017). Blues team officials note the ability of
                    the Enterprise Center to serve as a community gathering place, enhancing the emotional bond between
                    the team and St. Louis (Kelly 2019). Even national observers have noted the synergy between sport
                    and the St. Louis community. During the Blues’ improbable Stanley Cup-winning 2018-2019 season, an
                    ESPN reporter judged that the success of the team helped to improve the collective morale and give
                    momentum to urban renewal efforts while reducing national perceptions of high crime and racial
                    inequalities in St. Louis (Wagoner 2019).</p>
                <p>However, assessing the economic impact of St. Louis’s sports projects is complicated. Detractors
                    argue that little additional spending has been created. Instead fans have realigned their
                    consumption from elsewhere in the region. Multiple downtown restaurants and bars have closed since
                    2014 and their owners have attributed that loss of clientele to Ballpark Village—the “Ballpark
                    Village Effect” (Click 2014, 32; see also Bryant 2014; Pistor 2015; Barker 2016; Johnson 2016;
                    Barker 2017a). More specifically, critics argue St. Louis redevelopment “mega-projects” have not
                    provided economic benefits to underfunded neighborhoods (Pistor 2015, p. A1; see also Miller 2002).
                    The sports core and domain comprise only a tiny percentage of the land area in St. Louis City,
                    leading to questions of how far the impact of sport extends beyond each stadium. The Dome at
                    America’s Center, in particular, has a minimal influence in the region as it is underused, does not
                    reflect regional architecture, and is a closed structure that is physically isolated from the
                    surrounding urban fabric.</p>
                <p>Criticisms aside, since the early 1990s St. Louis political and economic leaders have embraced the
                    trend of utilizing sport to promote entertainment and tourism. Due to their larger scope, Busch
                    Stadium III and adjacent Ballpark Village are currently the best example of the transformative power
                    of sport in St. Louis. Numerous baseball fans frequent the new Ballpark Village neighborhood and
                    leisure space. As time goes on, the potential synergy between the Enterprise Center, Union Station,
                    and the new MLS stadium may also strengthen the western end of the St. Louis Sports Entertainment
                    District. All four structures are within four blocks of a MetroLink station, the (currently
                    underused) regional transit system, allowing for quick movement of fans in and out of downtown,
                    particularly on gamedays when multiple teams host home games.</p>
                <p>The long-term impacts of COVID-19 economic restrictions are difficult to predict. Since spring 2020
                    teams and fan-dependent businesses in the St. Louis Sports Entertainment District have struggled to
                    maintain their consumption-based business models during an unexpected economic disruption. One
                    downtown bar reported a 40 percent drop in business in 2020 while other bars and restaurants have
                    reduced their operations to weekends only due to the limited number of fans and tourists (Graves and
                    Heffernan 2020). The extension of COVID-19 attendance restrictions into the 2021 sports season
                    continue to limit team and local business revenue. However with other economic development options
                    in St. Louis limited, the transformation of the St. Louis’s landscape through sport and
                    sports-related entertainment will continue.</p>
