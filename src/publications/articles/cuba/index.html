                    <h3> Introduction </h3>
                    <p>
                        " <a class="location" data-layer-id="cuba">Cuba</a> is the largest country in the world,” announced our government-assigned guide. “Did you know that?” He continued with a sardonic grin, “Yes, the capitol is in Moscow, the army is in Africa, the doctors are all in Venezuela, and the population is all in Florida!” His joke was one of a series reflecting the oft-wielded sarcastic wit of Cubans as they cope with the challenges of daily life. But the Cuban diaspora is no laughing matter.  Multiple trips and countless conversations consistently reveal fragmented families;  daughters and sons, fathers and mothers reside and work in Spain or Canada, Italy and Mexico and especially the United States, an estimated 1.7 million (Duany 2017). Two days later, I lunched with a professor of geography from the University of Havana.  His mood was far from jesting as he observed, “Cuba may have to begin importing laborers from India or China.”Imagining a Cuba-cum-Qatar is not a concept easily processed; nor is tracking Cuba’s journey from the halcyon years of the 1970s to the demographic dilemma of 2018.
                 <!-- <a href="#" class="location" data-layer-id="elvizcaino"></a> <a href="#figure1">1</a> -->
                    </p>
                        The professor’s comment was prompted by local evidence of a recent reform; President Raúl Castro had announced that Cubans could once again sell and buy real estate, including their homes.  This is precipitating a modest building boom in parts of Havana to restore some of the grand 19th and early 20th century homes, those that have not already collapsed.  Domestic monies for restoration are scant but a growing flow of Cuban Americans is investing in the enterprise, primarily by sending money to relatives.It is a signal of change that those who emigrate were once repudiated as <i>gusanos</i> (worms), Fidel’s favorite epithet, or more formally as <i>traidores</i> (traitors). With the loss of Soviet-bloc subsidies and ensuing economic crisis the traidores found themselves welcomed back under a vastly different label --<i>trae dólares</i> (bringers of dollars).  But this economic opening is hindered by a dearth of available workers even in the wake of the announcement that “at least” 500,000 Cubans are losing their government jobs. The hope is that yet another reform legalizing several hundred kinds of self-employment, including carpentry, painting, and construction will absorb those laid off.  Indeed, the paladar providing our lunch had formerly been a large private home in Vedado.  Still another reform allowed its conversion into a restaurant serving, as yet, mainly tourists.

                    <p>
                        In all likelihood much of the capital for this <i>paladar</i> came from Cubans living abroad. Clearly, a construction worker shortage is just the warning tip of a demographic iceberg. Over the span of four visits to the Island since 2011, the graying of the population has emerged time and again as a topic initiated by Cubans. The discussion has many facets which seem unfortunately to be converging now in a type of negative spiral or synergy.  Ironically, some of the laudable social strides forged by <i>La Revolución</i> now seem to beset the nation.

                    <h3>Cuba's Middle Age Spread </h3>

                    <p>
                        Cuba’s age structure diagram reveals multiple challenges for contemporary leadership, most if not all reflecting past practices. Immediately obvious is the bulge of several working age cohorts (40-54). These cohorts result from a period of higher fertility (CBR) beginning about 1955 and trending through the Revolution to peak in the mid-1960s at about 35/1000.  Some increased fertility is attributable to reforms extending employment, education, and health benefits to all Cubans, especially the rural poor. Rural assistance meant population growth was not just a matter of more children born but of more surviving. The infant mortality rate (IMR) in 1960 was approximately 39/1000, a number that would systematically be pulled down to present figures in the 6.5 range.  However, Cuban fertility has also consistently fallen (apart from a small upturn in the 1980s) as women gain both more education and access to birth control. In a sense rural clinics were a two-edged demographic sword.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div id="figure3" class="figure contain" style="background-image:url(img/fig3.png);"></div>
                    <div class="caption">Figure 3: Source: Population Pyramid.net (https://populationpyramid.net/cuba/2016/)</div>

                    <p>
                        Presently, the bulge represents a positive dependency ratio, assuming adequate sources of productive employment. However, a sizeable workforce bloc is within a decade of retirement, as much as 10 percent. Aware of this eventuality leadership has raised the age for pension eligibility from 55 to 60 years for women and from 60 to 65 for men.  This extends the workforce a few years with older and experienced workers who presumably need little new training. One must question the logic, however, of extending the working age of some while simultaneously dropping half a million from the labor force. Is the “bottom line” really budget, or delayed pensions, or smaller payrolls?  Does the right hand know what the left hand is doing?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Not only may older Cubans extend their careers, retirees may return to the labor force while drawing a full pension, potentially increasing their total personal income by as much as 80-90 percent. Depending upon job type, some return to their previous position while in other cases retirees must seek new forms of employment. This constitutes a debit for the national treasury for despite reforms expanding the private sector most Cubans still work for the State. At least some older Cubans are anxious to supplement their pension with a new paycheck but to put this in perspective even if it means almost doubling personal income the official monthly amount would grow from $25 to less than $50 (U.S.).  To be sure, a recent survey indicates Cubans make more than this but not a lot more. One-in-four Cubans earns less than $50 per month, one-third take home $50 to $100, and one-fifth report their income as $101 to $200 per month (Miami Herald 2016). For individuals retirement can be a windfall but nationally it will not be a huge expenditure.  It is likely some retirees will try to move into aspects of the more lucrative tourist industry if they continue working. For them the opportunity to legally drive a taxi, operate or work in a <i>paladar</i>, or earn rent from a room in their home affords a significant supplement to a meagre pension. It also represents tax revenue for <a href="#" class="location" data-layer-id="havana">Havana</a>.

                <section id="3" class="scene" data-scene-id="place3" title="Lost Cohorts">
                    <h3> Lost Cohorts </h3>

                    <p>
                        Almost as soon as one’s eye fixes on the bulge it drops to the pinched waist in Cuba’s pyramid, most pronounced in the mid-30s age cohort.  Clearly, if the current largest cohorts had been even nominally fertile, even producing children at a replacement rate (Total Fertility Rate of 2.1) theoretically no gap or pinch would exist. But even with improving health conditions that did not happen. Instead, Cuba has a decades-long diminishing TFR that dropped below replacement even before 1980, the birth era of children unborn in the pinch. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Declining fertility is less than half the story.  The Cuban diaspora is typically defined as four waves of mass immigration.(<a href="#figure3">See Graph</a>)  The first in the immediate post-Revolution period (1959-1962) involved the departure of almost 120,000, most from the middle and upper socio-economic classes, and included more than 14,000 children sent ahead by distraught parents in Operation Pedro Pan. Some families were never reunited. Wave two (1965-1974) was more orderly based on various bi-lateral agreements that occasioned so-called Freedom Flights.  Wave three was anything but orderly.  Disenchanted Cubans demanded better living conditions and when leadership failed to respond denied some 10,000 sought asylum in the Peruvian Embassy compound.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Eventually told they could leave <a href="#" class="location" data-layer-id="cuba">Cuba</a>, but only through the designated port of <a href="#" class="location" data-layer-id="mariel">Mariel</a>, in just seven months in 1980, more than 125,000 “Marielitos” fled. Over the decade of the 1980s the total number of departing grew to more than 600,000. Loss of foreign aid from the defunct Soviet Bloc triggered the fourth and present wave beginning in 1989-1990. This largely working age exodus was heavily impacted by the bilateral agreement leading to the so-called Wet Foot, Dry Foot immigration policy (Miami Herald 1995), a program that rewarded any Cuban able to set foot on U.S. soil.  Lost to Cuba were skills and talents of thousands of young adults enticed away; lost to the waters of the Florida Straits additional hundreds if not thousands. Ironically, the threat of termination of this preferential program by the Obama administration provoked an additional hemorrhage of disaffected Cubans with more than 56,000 successfully reaching U.S. soil in 2016, the largest outpouring in more than a decade.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Migration, even “push” or impelled Cuban migration is age selective.  While not as selective as free or economic migration, in all such movement younger persons are more ready to pick up and move than older cohorts.  Disaffected citizens left Cuba in the 1980s and took with them their reproductive capacity and potential; the pinch came from lack of births but also lack of reproductive age cohorts.  They continue to do so in 2017.  But had these Cubans remained at home would the mandated layoff of workers be even larger?

            <section id="4" class="scene" title="A Unique Dilemma" data-scene-id="place4">
                <h3>A Unique Dilemma</h3>

                <p>
                    Cuba has no demographic peer in Latin America or the Caribbean.  If national population, birth rate, death rate, family size and the percent elderly are the metrics of comparison then one must look to Europe to find a country resembling Cuba.  Belgium is perhaps the closest match on all counts.  Government policies dating from the 1960s, e.g., universal education, tuition-free university degrees, full access to basic health care, including contraception and abortion, give Cuba a European demographic profile of long life, low fertility, and accumulating elderly citizens
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the Cuba - Europe analogy does not extend to measures such as net migration and per capita wealth.  Migrants enter Belgium, (NMR 1.22), typically they do not desire to leave, and per capita GDP in Cuba is only one-sixth that in Belgium.  In a sense the leaders of the Cuban Revolution created selected aspects of a workers’paradise but have failed to deliver on what they clearly consider less important, political and material benefits.  In response many Cubans, unable to vote otherwise, have cast their ballots by boat; emigration totals rose dramatically in 2015 and 2016 producing a Net Migration Rate of -3.66, while those staying home postpone or withhold their fertility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The narrowing base of the 2016 pyramid, if projected, will shrink the Island’s resident population. Cuba’s total population will peak by 2020 and then decline by more than one million by 2050 if current patterns persist. As early as 2026 projections have more Cubans dying than being born.  By mid-century Cuba will be a country of ten million and declining with one of the oldest age structures on the planet.This is the scenario envisioned earlier that Cuba will need to import laborers from demographically younger countries, and in all likelihood well before 2050. Of necessity could the historic Haiti-to-Cuba manual labor migration resume? Residents of this neighboring island are among the few in the region who would find Cuba’s artificially low wages marginally attractive. Have historic color biases truly been eliminated in Cuba’s socialist culture as some leaders aver?

                <h3>Reforming Reforms</h3>

                <p>
                    China’s ongoing lesson of the One Child Certificate is ample evidence that population is a stream and one does not alter the flow without future ramifications (Loo).  In this sense the imagery of the pyramid, solid and stable, is unfortunate.  Cuba’s earliest reforms to initiate fundamental change come from the immediate post-Revolution years.  Socialized free education, healthcare, and retirement security were all positive steps intended to correct the deplorable demographic and economic conditions of the Batista period and earlier.  In the process, additional spontaneous “reforms” were triggered.
                </p>

                    The broad impact of reforms is most evident in the extended life expectancy enjoyed by Cubans but also the low fertility prevailing.  Cubaphiles like to point out that on the Island life expectancy is actually longer than in the United States; Cubaphobes say “it only seems longer.” Few take the time to note that Cuba also has a lower crude birth rate and total fertility rate than its large nearby neighbor.  Even less recognized is the existence of a highly educated Cuban workforce but one without sufficient outlet for the skills and talents attained.  In a sense the Cuban system creates a surplus of skilled would-be workers.

                    Medical personnel are a case in point.  Many note the thousands of technically-trained Cubans who work temporarily across the globe with most being doctors. With low wages and poor working conditions at home, and a funded initiative by the United States’ government to lure them away – the so-called Cuban Medical Professional Parole (CMPP) program, doctors and other medical professional are enticed to defect (Erisman 2012).  <b>(Insert video here?)</b>  Others defect without leaving the Island by pursuing more lucrative employment.  Perhaps as a consequence Cuban citizens complain that their internationally touted national healthcare system is not what it used to be with both personnel and supplies sent abroad to treat non-Cubans. There is also a small but highly capable workforce in biotechnology and computer software design that lacks the means to truly go international on a larger scale although new opening for foreign investment could change this situation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Least noted, however, is the presence of thousands of Cubans willing to be sustained by a socialized system while exerting little personal effort.  Addressing the National Assembly in August, 2010, to explain drastic economic reforms President Raúl Castro warned “We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working” (Peters 2012). The occasion was the highly un-Socialist declaration that half a million redundant government employees would lose their jobs. Rising to their own defense workers are heard to say “They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work.”With low official salaries, absenteeism and low productivity chronic, the system struggles, demographically and economically. Layer upon layer of bureaucratic paper-pushing tolerated by Fidel as a means (or guise) of full employment is being phased out under Raúl the businessman.  It is patently unfair to compare Cuba, a system dedicated to poverty reduction and wealth redistribution, with countries with largely unrestrained capitalist economies.  But it may be instructive to note that Belgium with a population structure very similar to Cuba scores high in terms of worker productivity and efficiency.  The same can be said of other older, slow growth European nations but not of Cuba.

                <p>
                    After decades of commitment to collective and cooperative labor as the highest socialist ideal, the shock treatment of capitalist-like layoffs is an admission of urgency if not desperation. To be sure, the announced 500,000, which has grown to 600,000, are not set adrift all at once (Mesa-Lago 2014).  Change is piece-meal, re-training programs exist, and some workers even continue to receive paychecks from idle enterprises.  It is the way of Cuban socialism and all economic reforms are rolled out very, very cautiously and slowly.  The lessons of eastern European hasty reforms are well known in Havana. But of particular note is the publication of lists of approved forms of self-employment, some 201 at last count (Feinberg 2013).  Such lists are essential for it was not a decade ago that most forms of self-employment were illegal and one could be arrested, fined, or incarcerated.  Some suggest the lists of legal self-employment were inspired or at least reflect the more lucrative and popular aspects of the active Cuban black market. Clearly the lists go well beyond that.

                    The nature of approved private sector jobs speaks to inclusiveness, or perhaps the obsessive compulsive nature among Cuban government planners.  No stone is left unturned.  Hawking “new” private sector careers is about economic urgency and the need to identify jobs for the recently terminated.  For example, among the more quaint proffered careers are <i>Button-Coverer</i> or <i>Operator of Children’s Fun Wagon Pulled by Pony or Goat</i>, while <i>Refiller and Repairer of Disposable Lighters</i> drips with desperation. It is impossible to imagine technically trained members of Cuba’s workforce or even retirees seriously considering such enterprises when the government safety net, though strained, continues to function in the name of the Revolution.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    To be sure, forms of potentially lucrative self-employment are scattered within the list: construction, auto repair, taxi driver, restaurant (paladar) operator, and room/home renter, all provide a link to expanding tourism.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    A few of the jobs are more technical. Services for newly legal businesses, namely, accountants, computer programmers, insurance agents, office equipment repair, real estate broker, and telecommunication agent support expansion of the private sector. These reflect promotion of an expanded private sector with the blessings of Cuba’s leadership but truly many represent services previously provided by the black market.  The difference is now taxes are assessed.  Sometimes these are anticipatory based on the projected earnings of an enterprise and payable in advance.  This, along with thick layers of bureaucratic red tape explains the reported failure of one out of five new businesses.  It is safe to assume the more efficient Cuban black market is far from out of business.

                <h3> "Free" Land </h3>

                <p>
                    Cuba has seldom adequately fed itself.  Either it has sold sugar and tobacco to buy foodstuffs or relied upon Soviet-bloc largess.  Moscow’s subsidies are gone, sugar is in steep decline, the duration of cheap Venezuelan oil is uncertain, and food insecurity  persists.  The turn to tourism does not address food needs, indeed it creates an additional demand.  In response two strategies are operating.  One is the proliferation of <i>organopónicos</i> (organic farms) typically on the outskirts of major cities which produce some vegetables, herbs, medicinal and ornamental plants. By volume their total contribution to national food needs is not great though they play a role in the tourist market.
                </p>

                <div id="figure5" class="figure contain" style="background-image:url(img/fig5.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption">Figure 5:  This organic farm is on the outskirts of <div class="caption"><a class="location" data-layer-id="havana">Havana</a>.  It produces vegetables, various herbs, and some medicinal plants while rejecting the use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, or insecticides.</div>

                <p>
                    Strategy two is the legalization of “<i>terrenos usufructos.</i>” This is a radical reversal of half a century of State control of farmland and collectivized labor, seminal tenets of the Revolution. Qualifying citizens obtain the use of idle land (there is no transfer of ownership or title) via a “free” rent program for a prescribed period, ten years for individuals. The State commands 70% of production at prices set below market value to prevent “excessive accumulation of wealth” by private operators.  While the balance is used at the discretion of the operator, at least until 2013 it had to be sold through government channels that are notoriously inefficient.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cuba remains far from the point of domestic food security and costly imports continue to deplete national coffers.  As for the <i>terrenos usufructos</i>, about 300,000 have been taken up.  But their total production is less than anticipated.  Part of this is because a sizeable acreage is not actively cultivated. The formerly idle lands require great effort to put them back into production and usufrutarios typically lack capital. Perhaps more critically official sources report that 77% of <i>usufructarios</i> have no prior agricultural experience. One significant obstacle is marabú.  This thorny bush is invasive in idle lands and half of the <i>terrenos usufructos</i> are plagued by this pest.  The vision that a significant portion of the 600,000 State workers laid off would take up land and begin growing food for the nation is illusory.  One might suggest that very few younger Cubans will depart preferred city living, often with university degrees in hand and find small scale farming an attractive option to unemployment, to jobs in the expanding tourism sector, or to emigration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A hint of what is happening in Cuba’s private sector food agriculture can be found in the list of legal self-employed enterprises.  Among the 201 jobs the designation “farmer” is conspicuously absent.  As close as we find is “part-time farm laborer.”On the other hand the following authorized enterprises do appear:  Maker of Yokes, Harnesses and Rope for Oxen, Thresher, Saddle and Harness Repair, and Mule Driver. Travel about the Cuban countryside and it is evident that draft or work animals are widely used in food agriculture.  In part this reflects the uncertainty of adequate and affordable fuel supplies.  Likewise, it underscores this fact.  Surviving private farm operations in Cuba, and the <i>terrenos usufructos</i> are small scale farms.  The largest allowed <i>usufructo</i> is 67 hectares and typically only a portion of this is under active cultivation.  Small in size and often under-capitalized, such parcels are more likely to be farmed with manual labor and animals than with machines.  In 2016, farmers in Pinar del Rio cut rice with a hand sickle and thresh it with a winnowing technique unchanged for 200 years!  Indeed, there are jobs for makers of ox or mule harness and drivers of the same but it is highly unlikely these will be taken up by former government employees just entering the private sector.

                <p>
                    Of Cuba’s total agricultural land, just 3.3% is listed as in private hands.  By 2012, only 23,000 “private” farms survived from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1960s. But even these farmers are subject to a degree of State control, especially in terms of acquiring inputs and legally selling their production.  Fidel Castro was notorious for radical policy changes and small private farmers felt the impact of his whimsy.  So-called “free” peasant markets (Mercado Libre Campesino) were created in 1980 but scuttled in 1986 because “peasants” were making too much money.  But with the reforms of brother Raúl, there is a degree of optimism that private farmers will be allowed a degree of economic freedom but he is loosening his grip on the reins ever so carefully and gradually. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    And how does an ageing Cuban population fit into this picture of semi-private farming?  In all countries with a strong rural-to-urban shift, rural regions have been left   with a residual of older residents unwilling to move as younger cohorts leave to seek education, employment, and perceived social advantage in the cities or even abroad. This is especially true where there is or has been a significant development of agriculture.  Farmers tend to be born into their careers.  There are few examples of urban folk willingly and in significant numbers migrating into the countryside to engage full-time in agriculture. China’s experience sending urban residents into the countryside during the Cultural Revolution was a disaster.  It is unlikely to occur in Cuba. From 1990 to 2014, Cuban sugar production dropped by 80% (FAOSTAT).  It was part of the downward spiral of national agriculture precipitated in part by the ending of Soviet-bloc subsidies.  For several years post-1991 Cubans tightened their belts, not owing just to Fidel’s urgings but to avoid wardrobe malfunction.  It was a time of true hunger.  Not surprisingly, in 1997 a decree law sought to stem the rural flow to Havana of those hoping to escape rural decay.  With resultant accelerated ageing who then is left to farm save older Cubans? Younger cohorts are too well educated, prefer urban employment, have higher expectations, or perhaps favor emigration.

                <p>
                    On both organopónicos and private farms the labor force observed is primarily middle aged or older.  Even on the organic farms in or near cities older workers are the norm.  Farms in the hinterland are even more dependent upon veteran farmers and their families. Youth have not jumped at the chance to be a <i>usufructario</i> and grow malanga and rice to feed the nation. Cuba’s national goal to grow more food and to be less dependent upon expensive imports, most of which now come from the United States, rests upon an ageing population destined to dwindle through natural attrition.

                <p>
                    “Fidel died last night” the landlady quietly informed me as she prepared breakfast.  She was composed but visibly saddened as she delivered the news.  Over the next several days of official mourning, in Havana and in the countryside, Cubans gathered to pay respects to the primary architect of their socialized lifestyle.  In private a few expressed relief for the end of Fidelismo.  The prevailing public mood is best described as reserved; clearly authorities had orchestrated a celebration that brought multiple international heads-of-state to pay homage to the iconic Fidel.

                <p>
                    Amidst the lavish eulogies of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro or the praise of his Nicaraguan acolyte Daniel Ortega, Fidel and his role in Cuba’s development was soberly assessed by Cubans in private conversation.  An academic commented that using Cuba’s meagre resources Fidel had tried to change the world, but his brother Raúl is just trying to fix Cuba’s problems.  Also heard is “Fidel was the visionary with his head always in the clouds while his brother is the businessman with his feet on the ground.  We are encouraged by that.”This begs the question “does Cuba have a reason to be optimistic, even quietly optimistic?” Hard demographic times are ahead. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Across Cuba citizens lined up to pay their respects, signing official memorial books or leaving flowers beneath photos of the young Fidel or the Cuban flag.  Elementary students in their uniforms chattered as they waited with single flower blossoms.  Their mood seemed more the excitement of a break in class routine.  Little sadness was apparent as they prepared to say good-bye to the figure often appearing in their textbooks or quoted by their teachers.  Compared to the relative number of children in much of Latin America Cuban children seem fewer in number, better dressed, more orderly.  One wonders the future roles they will play.

                    Television cameras capturing the official scene in <a class="location" data-layer-id="havana">Havana’s Plaza de la Revolución</a> documented a different generational scene.  Passing by the urn where Fidel’s mortal ashes lay in state casually dressed 20-something Cuban youth captured their own scene with “selfies.” One imagined a stirring in the urn for this intrusion of social media, an emerging reality so strongly resisted by the bearded old man.  Dominating the mourning queue, however, were middle aged and older men and women.  Most were stoic; a few wept, some openly.  The words of the landlady came back: “My heart hurts and I am sad to hear of his death, but my son who travels a lot outside Cuba simply says ‘it is time to move on.’” Which generation will prevail?
