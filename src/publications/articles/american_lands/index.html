                <p>
           Upon hearing the term “America’s public lands,” what comes to mind for many people is the National Park System, and for good reason. The national parks form the crown jewel of the system of public lands in the United States, as illustrated by this photograph of the Grand Canyon. When President Theodore Roosevelt first saw the canyon in 1903, he stated: “Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children’s children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.” The Grand Canyon was not a national park when Roosevelt made that statement, but he used the power of his office to initiate a process by which it became one of the earliest national parks in the country. In the face of opposition by development interests, Roosevelt acted to ensure that this “great sight” would be preserved for future generations, and the National Park Service has been doing that very thing for over 100 years.

                 <p>
But public lands in the United States do much more that preserve awe-inspiring natural environments for posterity. The system of public lands serves a range of conservation as well as preservation purposes, and it is important to distinguish two points. First is that America’s public lands exist as a system of separate but interrelated components. While development of such a system was not generally intended historically, what emerged and exists today is an arrangement for managing public lands to meet a variety of purposes. The second point is to make distinction between preservation and conservation. Preservation entails maintaining natural environments in their present condition and as untouched by humans as possible while conservation involves the sustainable use and management of natural environments and their resources to meet the needs and interests of people.

             While public lands exist at state and local levels as well as federal, the focus in this essay is upon federal public lands. Four agencies carry primary responsibility for managing these lands that stretch across the United States, and each pursues a unique mission within the public lands system. The NPS focuses on preserving natural environments and cultural heritage and upon fostering public visitation and appreciation of these places. The USFWS works mainly to preserve habitat for wildlife conservation and maintenance of biological diversity, and it manages the National Wildlife Refuge System. The USFS has primarily a conservation mission that advances multiple, sustainable use of the environment for forestry, grazing, mining, watershed regulation, recreation, and some ecological preservation functions, along with others. The BLM has historically managed land for extractive resource development, and while this remains a priority, the agency is increasing its emphasis on multiple use with particular emphasis on identification of special areas for conservation and restoration. Toward this latter end, the agency manages the National Landscape Conservation System (now known as the National Conservation Lands).

                <p>
             This map from the Congressional Research Service shows the distribution of federal lands across the coterminous United States. The four main land management agencies are displayed along with Department of Defense (DOD) lands which consist of military bases, training ranges, and other functions not principally managed for either preservation or conservation. Federal land ownership is concentrated in the West, in part reflecting the settlement history of the country. States in the East were settled early in the country’s history when the priority of the federal government was to “dispose” of the lands, that is, to transfer ownership of the lands to private persons and interests for settlement and use by the country’s growing population and expanding economy. Lands in the West were settled later when federal emphasis on “disposal” decreased and conservation and preservation increased in priority.

            Looking first at NPS lands, Yosemite National Park was established in 1890 as the country’s second national park. The top photo above shows the granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley that were carved by glaciers and rise over 3,600 feet above the valley floor. The photo on the right shows the vertical granite walls of the valley, while the bottom photo shows the Tenaya Lake area in the Yosemite high country with the lake surrounded by granite domes, forests of lodgepole pine, and Yosemite’s vast wilderness.

				<p>This park is certainly one of the crown jewels of America’s public lands, and it borders another one, Yellowstone National Park. Both parks are surrounded by USFS lands that taken all together form the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the largest nearly intact temperate zone ecosystems on Earth that contains the largest concentration of wildlife in the lower 48 states.

            While part of the National Park System, this is a “monument” and not a “park.” National parks result from legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by a president while national monuments are established by presidential proclamation under authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. Parks are as close to permanent as possible in the U.S. system of government, but the status of monuments is more uncertain. Some monuments, such as Organ Pipe pictured here with silhouettes of organ pipe and saguaro cacti at sunset in the Sonoran Desert, are managed by NPS and have very secure status. But national monuments can be managed by any of the federal public lands agencies, and in recent days, the status of some of them is being disputed.

            This park contains ecosystems in pristine condition such as the rugged, cliffed Pacific shore and a temperate rainforest. The top photo shows the huge logs that float down the raging rivers in this high rainfall zone and are deposited along the beach. The bottom photo shows Tatoosh Island which lies offshore from Cape Flattery, the westernmost point in the 48 contiguous states. The park has been recognized internationally by UNESCO as an International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site, and as such, is legally protected by international treaties as well as by the U.S. government.

            Lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service include the 560 National Wildlife Refuges, many of which lie along one of the north-south “flyways” for migratory birds. The Bosque del Apache NWR lies on the Rio Grande River and serves as wintering ground for various bird species including the Snow Geese and Sandhill Cranes shown here. Because the Rio Grande has been dammed extensively and the water diverted for irrigation of farms, the natural cycles of alternating floods and slack water periods no longer provide the habitats in which these birds and other wildlife can flourish. Consequently, this refuge is managed to mimic those natural cycles by use of small canals, gates, and dams that flood and drain areas on seasonal schedules. In addition to management of the National Wildlife Refuge system, the USFWS performs a wide range of additional services: working with private landowners to establish easements that help to conserve and restore wildlife habitat; determining species that are endangered or threatened and developing plans for their protection; protecting and restoring fisheries and operating fish hatcheries; and enforcing federal wildlife laws.

            This refuge is part of a complex that consists of bottomland hardwoods, early successional reforestation areas, various fields, and moist soil units that are located in the low lying lands of the Mississippi Delta region. Bisected by the meandering Tippo Bayou, the Tallahatchie NWR is managed to conserve and restore the historically extensive forested wetlands of this region that has been largely deforested and drained for commercial agricultural production. This kind of habitat conservation and restoration is a primary goal of the USFWS.

           The USFS was created in 1905 when previously established forest reserves were consolidated into one agency with a clear conservation mandate. As the name implies, a primary mission of the USFS is to manage the nation’s forests, protecting them from wastefulness and ensuring sustainable timber yields. This mission considers forests to be a form of agriculture that provides an important reason for housing this agency in the Department of Agriculture. Livestock grazing and hunting are also considered agricultural pursuits and form part of the “multiple use” mission well-expressed in the motto, “Land of Many Uses.” Recognizing the conflicting interests that would arise through this “multiple use” mission, Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the USFS, stated, “[W]here conflicting interests must be reconciled, the question shall always be decided from the standpoint of the greatest good of the greatest number in the long run,” another motto of the USFS.

            One of the main functions of national forests is to secure watersheds in the forested mountains so as to mitigate flooding in the rainy season and ensure a steady supply of water to the valleys throughout the year. This photo shows the Taylor River.

            The agricultural lands of the Surprise Valley lie below the forested slopes of the Warner Range that are managed by the USFS to, in part, ensure stable water flows to the valley. The national forest lands provide this public good to the private sector agricultural interests and this emphasizes another reason why the USFS finds its home in the Department of Agriculture.

            Important parts of the “multiple use” mission of the USFS are restoration and preservation. The photo on the left shows restoration of the endangered black-footed ferret while the photo on the right shows a trailhead into a wilderness area. Signed into law in 1964, The Wilderness Act recognized wilderness as “an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.” While wilderness areas have been established in all four of the public lands agencies, most wilderness areas are managed by the USFS.

            Recreation is an important part of the “multiple use” mission of the national forests. Recreation encompasses many uses and includes exploring by four-wheel drive vehicles, bicycles, river rafts, horseback, and by backpacking on foot.

            This photo is the view toward the southwest from the eastern shoulder of the Aquarius Plateau. Much of the plateau lies above 11,000 feet elevation and the forested slopes are managed by the USFS. The BLM manages the land in the background.

            This view from the Kaibab Plateau in Arizona is looking north toward the Grand Staircase of Western Geology with its sequence of brightly colored cliffs that rise 5,500 feet and display 275 million years of geologic history. Most of it is preserved as federal public land with much of it in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument (GSENM). The monument was established in 1996 on BLM land by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act which states that monuments be established to protect, in part, objects of “scientific interest” and that monument size must be the “smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.” Debate swirls around the size of GSENM, but a key question remains, what is the smallest size needed to protect this landscape that is the “object of scientific interest?”

            The BLM was created rather recently, in 1946, through a merging of existing federal agencies that centered on grazing and mining, and that focus persisted with the new agency. The logo created for the agency in 1952 shows a surveyor, logger, engineer, rancher, and miner standing shoulder to shoulder, and it symbolizes the agency’s emphasis at that time on resource extraction and development. Behind the men is a wagon train on the open prairie suggesting the past while in front of them lies a landscape symbolic of the imagined, developed future of railroad tracks, buildings, and other infrastructure. But a few years later, when the so-named “Environmental Decade” of the 1960s saw the rise of considerable efforts to address environmental issues, some governmental efforts impacted federal land management agencies, including the BLM. Even though the logo changed in 1964 to reflect the new priorities. it wasn’t until 1976 that the agency received a legislated mission from Congress to incorporate sustainable yield principles and multiple use values that included “scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource and archeological” considerations.

            The BLM manages the National Conservation Lands that are areas identified as ecologically rich and culturally significant. Ten designations exist and include National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails. Established originally by the Department of Interior in 2000 and then legislated by Congress in 2009, this system recognizes that genuine conservation of natural and cultural resources entails protecting large areas that cover entire ecosystems and archaeological communities.

			Federal public lands have been an inseparable part of American life since the country began. They played an essential role in establishment of the Articles of Confederation following the Revolutionary War when the former colonies agreed to cede to the nascent federal government much of their claims to land extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. Federal authority over public lands was reinforced a few years later in the Constitution, and moreover, Article 4 of the Constitution stipulated a primary goal of Congress to “dispose” of the public lands to private interests for development of the country and its economy. This goal persisted throughout the 19th century and into the 20th in forms such as the Homestead Act, federal railroad grants, and other actions.                </p>

                <p>
				But change in the purpose of public lands began to emerge even in the early 20th century, as illustrated by President Theodore Roosevelt’s words in 1903 that the Grand Canyon was a “great wonder of nature [that should] remain as it now is.” The ideas of conservation and preservation of public lands grew with establishment of the USFS in 1905 and the NPS in 1916, agencies that advanced those goals throughout the 20th century. Then the “Environmental Decade” of the 1960s amplified recognition that public lands could play a crucial role in retaining a natural world that was diminishing in the face of the dominant development paradigm of resource extraction and use to fuel economic expansion. In 1976, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) established law that formally reversed the policy of land “disposal” by recognizing the value of public lands and declaring that they should remain in public ownership.                </p>

                <p>
				Today in the United States, that dominant development paradigm seems to be producing diminishing marginal returns as it becomes increasingly questionable that continuous growth is a sustainable trajectory. And yet, human striving to maintain that paradigm is resulting in increased pressure to limit preservation of public lands and to push use of them to levels that could exceed sustainable conservation. Public lands have always been important in the velocity of development occurring in the United States, but it appears that now they have become central to the trajectory of that development as well.
