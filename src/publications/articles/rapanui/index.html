                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Many places in the world have competing national identities etched into their landscapes,
                    especially in cases of colonialism. Notable examples include Quebec in Canada, Tibet in China,
                    and Hawai’i in the United States of America. <a class="location" data-layer-id="rapanui">Rapa
                        Nui</a> (Easter Island) makes a great case study
                    of this phenomenon as the only Polynesian island that was colonized by a Latin American
                    country – Chile. As a result of its colonial past and present, competing Chilean and Rapa Nui
                    national identities manifest themselves in the landscape of the island of Rapa Nui. For example,
                    the Chilean flag is present around government buildings, the airport, and in taxis, while the Rapa
                    Nui flag flies in front of homes and private businesses. The Spanish language is mostly heard in
                    the streets of Hanga Roa, the only settlement on Rapa Nui. Meanwhile the Rapa Nui language, a
                    close relative of the Tahitian language, is heard mainly in islander’s homes and at cultural and
                    religious festivals and rituals.</p>
                </br>
                <p>Chile annexed the island in 1888, and to this day there is an active Rapa Nui
                    independence movement. This movement does not recognize Chilean sovereignty on the island
                    (see Figure 11), and its extensive protesting has helped the Rapa Nui community achieve a
                    greater degree of autonomy and control over island resources in recent years. The Rapa Nui
                    protesters cite their Polynesian ancestry, language, arts, and of course <i>moai</i> (enormous,
                    mysterious statues, see Figures 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) as things that set them apart from the rest of Chile.
                    The one thousand or so <i>moai</i> scattered around the island are an integral part of Rapa Nui
                    heritage, and bolster Rapa Nui claims of indigeneity to the island. These impressive and
                    mysterious stone structures pre-date Chilean colonization, and attest to the island’s Polynesian
                    heritage and demonstrate the uniqueness of the Rapa Nui community. The original inhabitants of
                    this island were and are Polynesian, but 133 years of Chilean governance of this Polynesian
                    island have created a built landscape that is just as much Chilean as it is Rapa Nui in the
                    twentyfirst
                    century.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>I spent three months on Rapa Nui in 2018 teaching English and conducting research on
                    the impacts of the island’s tourism industry and Chile’s governance on the contemporary
                    community of the island. The project entailed using qualitative field methods, including in-depth
                    semi-structured interviews with Chilean and Rapa Nui individuals who live on the island, and
                    quotes from several participants are included in this paper (with pseudonyms). I also conducted
                    archival research in the island’s only library, attended cultural spaces and events like the
                    island’s museum, indigenous dance shows, and Rapa Nui mass at the Catholic Church, and took many
                    pictures of the natural and built landscape, some of which are included in this essay (all photos in
                    this essay by Jesse Edward Tenenbaum in 2018).</p>

                <h3>About Rapa Nui</h3>
                <p><a class="location" data-layer-id="rapanui">Rapa
                        Nui</a>, also called Easter Island, is situated in the South Pacific Ocean, approximately
                    2,000 miles west of the coast of <a class="location" data-layer-id="chile">Chile</a>, and
                    approximately 2,500 miles southeast of <a class="location" data-layer-id="tahiti">Tahiti</a>. It
                    sits
                    just a few degrees of latitude south of the tropic of Capricorn, giving the island a relatively mild
                    climate year-round, with distinct wet and dry seasons – the wet season corresponding with their
                    winter and the dry season during their summer months, which are the inverse of the northern
                    hemisphere’s seasons. There is no land directly north of the island for about 3,000 miles, where
                    <a class="location" data-layer-id="cabosanlucas">Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</a> is located, and no land
                    south of the island for approximately 3,000
                    miles, where one reaches the shores of <a class="location"

                    island being deemed the most isolated inhabited island in the world (see Figures 1 & 2 for
                    distances from other places around the world). The island itself is approximately 63 square miles
                    and has a triangular shape, with extinct volcanoes forming each point of the triangle. For a size
                    comparison, the island can fit inside Lake Tahoe (Nevada/California, USA) three times!

                <p>Since landscapes often provide a canvas for representing identity, groups within a
                    territory will manifest their identity by making marks on the landscape, such as erecting flags,
                    buildings, monuments, artwork, graffiti and other signs. The landscape on Rapa Nui serves as a
                    canvas for competing claims of Rapa Nui and Chilean sovereignties and national identities. The
                    importance of language as an expression of identity in the landscape cannot be understated. For
                    example, Gade (2003) discusses the symbolic value of the French language in relation to
                    Quebecois identity and nationalism and of the Catalan language in relation to Catalan identity
                    and nationalism. Similarly, Rose-Redwood et al (2010) demonstrate the importance of place
                    names to groups who claim a special connection with a place. On Easter Island the use of the
                    Rapa Nui language and place names is an integral part of the expression of Rapa Nui identity
                    (Latorre, 2001; Makihara, 2005), especially as symbolic resistance against political domination
                    by Chile (Makihara, 2005). <a class="location" data-layer-id="fig5">Figure 5</a> below provides a
                    poignant example of Rapa Nui resistance to
                    Chile’s presence on the island, with direct messages stating that the Chilean government is
                    responsible for the hardships that indigenous peoples face in their country.

                <h3>Imagined Community and Banal Nationalism: Relevance on Rapa Nui</h3>
                <p>Anderson’s (1991) notion of “imagined community” in discussions of nationalism is
                    relevant to the cases of Rapa Nui and Chile. In his work, Anderson postulates that feelings of
                    nationalism persist among groups of people even though most people living in a state’s territory
                    will likely never even meet one another, and therefore their comradeship is imagined. He cites
                    the development of print capitalism as an influential factor in this phenomenon. The quicker and
                    easier distribution of printed items allowed for a rise in literacy and language dissemination,
                    which helped to solidify the use of particular languages in particular geographic areas,
                    snowballing into larger ideas of nations based on shared languages (and other cultural practices)
                    deserving of sovereignty in specific territorial boundaries. This idea is applicable to Chile’s
                    structure as a nation-state, in that it is nearly impossible for all 18 million Chileans to meet and
                    know each other closely. Therefore, it can be said that their comradery as individuals who are
                    proud of their Chilean national identity is imagined. The case of nationalistic sentiment is
                    different on Rapa Nui, because virtually all five thousand (or so) Rapa Nui individuals do indeed
                    know each other or at least of each other, and consequently their bond and sense of cohesion as a
                    community with a distinct identity is strong.</p>
                </br>
                <p>Billig’s (1995) notion of banal nationalism is apparent in the presence of Chilean flags
                    strategically placed at key sites like government buildings, the airport (see Figures <a
                        class="location" data-layer-id="fig10">10</a>, <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="fig14">14</a>), and
                    private businesses, a subtle but obvious reminder of Chile’s investment of money, resources, and
                    personnel in governing and providing for the island. By simply observing the landscape I was
                    able to garner a sense of the dichotomy - but also the mixing of - Rapa Nui and Chilean identities
                    and nationalistic claims. The island’s volcanic terrain, tropical flora, artwork and handicrafts
                    give the island a distinctly Polynesian feel, but a number of the businesses, government
                    buildings, and all of the license plates are distinctly Chilean. Rapa Nui flags and symbols are
                    seen flying on the grounds of private homes and in some businesses, as well as accompanying
                    protest signs scattered around Hanga Roa (see Figures <a class="location"

                <p>The omnipresence of the island’s archaeological heritage has resulted in many Rapa Nui
                    residents saying that “the island is a museum.” Chilean flags are symbolic of the Chilean state’s
                    sovereignty over the island, and consequently are present at government buildings, and many
                    businesses, and taxi cars. The Rapa Nui flag is seen in public places, like in the park (Figure 9),
                    but often the Rapa Nui flag is present at businesses who want to demonstrate that they are owned
                    by a Rapa Nui family, and are found at some people’s personal homes. The Rapa Nui flag
                    contains a <i>reimiro</i>, which is a Polynesian canoe with human faces at each end. The
                    <i>reimiro</i> is
                    symbolic of the Rapa Nui people’s descendance from talented seafarers, as Polynesians are
                    known for their excellent canoe building and navigation skills (conversations with Rapa Nui
                    residents, see it in Figures 5, 9, 11, 13). The Rapa Nui have revived their culture and connected
                    with their heritage but are simultaneously contending with increasing Chilean and international
                    cultural influences (Aguirre & González, 2012). On the other hand, Chile is promoting and
                    encouraging the Rapa Nui cultural renaissance because it appeals to tourists. At the same time
                    Chile is working to discourage the Rapa Nui independence movement in order to maintain political
                    control of the island and its surrounding waters (Delsing, 2009). It is apparent that the
                    cultural heritage tourism industry plays a vital role in both the process of Rapa Nui cultural
                    revival/perpetuation, which can be referred to as “rapanuization” (Andueza, 2000), and the
                    process of increasing Chilean culture and presence on the island, or “chilenization” (Bustos
                    González, 2006).

                    The concept of the Rapa Nui as a distinctly Polynesian people is an integral part of the
                    self-identification of the community and is often the basis for the vocal minority of Rapa Nui
                    individuals who advocate for independence from Chile. This vocal minority is represented by the
                    Rapa Nui parliament, where there is a sign claiming that Rapa Nui will never acknowledge
                    Chilean sovereignty over the island. <a class="location" data-layer-id="fig11">Figure 11</a> shows
                    how that process is expressed in the
                    landscape, with a sign that translates as “Territorial Assembly” and an explanation, geared to
                    outsiders, that the kingdom of Rapa Nui never ceded sovereignty to Chile. The sign references
                    the treaty of 1888, in which Chile annexed Rapa Nui (Gómez 2010). The Rapa Nui identity is
                    clearly important enough for a number of people to actively – and sometimes vehemently –
                    protest against Chile’s governance on the island and against the ability of mainland Chileans to
                    immigrate to the island.

                <p>
                    Another example of Rapa Nui’s identities expressed in the cultural landscape is the huge
                    clock outside the entrance to the airport (<a class="location" data-layer-id="fig12">Figure 12</a>).
                    There are three clock faces aligned
                    vertically, with the top clock showing the time in Santiago, Chile, the middle clock showing the
                    time in Rapa Nui (two hours behind the continent) and the lowest clock showing the time in
                    Tahiti (five hours behind Rapa Nui). This structure does more than just tell time: it is symbolic of
                    the cultural, social, economic, and political links Rapa Nui has to both Latin America and
                    Polynesia. The clock is geographically informative, as the island sits approximately halfway
                    between the coast of Chile and the island of Tahiti, and the island only receives flights from
                    these two places. The three months I spent on Rapa Nui confirmed what I had started to
                    understand from my prior research, that the island is halfway between Chile and Polynesia
                    socially and culturally as well as geographically.

                    The Rapa Nui and Chilean identities are both influential factors in the conversations
                    island residents have regarding autonomy and/or independence for the island. The Rapa Nui who
                    want outright independence from Chile feel that the Rapa Nui identity must be upheld as the
                    dominant identity of the island’s people. Meanwhile, the current reality of the ever-increasing
                    <i>chilenidad</i> (Real Academia Española 2019) “Chilean-ness” of the island’s residents allows
                    Chile
                    to justify continued sovereignty and management of the island. The push for greater autonomy
                    while still remaining part of the Chilean state is a fitting option for the emerging new Rapa Nui
                    and its identities. This option strikes a balance between allowing the Rapa Nui to make important
                    decisions regarding land and natural resources while allowing Chile to maintain sovereignty.

                <h3>Discussions of Autonomy and Sovereignty: Perspectives from island residents</h3>
                <p>
                    While the Rapa Nui independence movement garners headlines from time to time, it is
                    the goal of a small but vocal minority of Rapa Nui individuals. That being said, almost every
                    Easter Island resident I interviewed – both Rapa Nui and Chilean – agreed that the island should
                    shift toward becoming more autonomous. They made a point of stressing that autonomy is not
                    the same as independence. A fairly standard consensus is that the island can and should become
                    more autonomous in terms of administration and bureaucracy. In particular, the consensus is that
                    more autonomy is needed in decisions about infrastructure, the environment, and education. Still,
                    most agree that being part of the Chilean state is more beneficial than harmful. Chile provides
                    greatly needed resources such as food, healthcare, and basic infrastructure and education, as well
                    as the flights that connect the island to the outside world. This connection is crucial to the
                    island’s economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism. Some Rapa Nui residents are resentful
                    of the fact that important decisions about the island are made by politicians and bureaucrats
                    thousands of miles away in Santiago and Valparaíso, many of whom have never even been to the
                    island and therefore have very limited understandings of life and the community there. Javier
                    (41), a Rapa Nui man who is very well known both on the island and in Chile for being a
                    successful businessman and media personality representing the Rapa Nui community in Chile
                    and abroad, said this to me:
                </p>
                <blockquote><i>So the correct word is auto-determination. All that you hear about
                        independence is that also – I’ll tell you – many Rapa Nui don’t
                        know what independence really is. They say it because they hear it
                        and repeat it...but in reality what we’re looking for is to make our own decisions, to be able
                        to
                        choose a government that can say
                        “yes, what is your authorization?...do you want this?” Yes, for us
                        to decide what happens, not some person in Valparaíso that has
                        never come (to the island) or that is in an office and doesn’t know
                        what happens (here)...</i> (August 9, 2018)
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This sentiment was shared by Flor, a 48-year-old Chilean woman who has lived on the island
                    most of her life, and other individuals I interviewed and spoke with during casual conversations
                    during my time on the island.
                </p>
                <blockquote><i>Well, what I believe is that the independence movement is a very
                        small one, that the majority of the people, that isn’t what they
                        want, um...but effectively there are some people, who are led by
                        the (Rapa Nui) Parliament and that are a small group, that...that
                        postulate this. I believe that the strongest movement is for
                        autonomy, and ultimately is to be able to be more autonomous in
                        making decisions here, belonging to Chile (still) because
                        ultimately, we know that it is complicated to be absolutely
                        independent. And I believe that we’re all in agreement to an extent

                        region – Chile is divided into regions, and the island belongs to a region, and all the
                        decisions have to pass through the fifth region
                        (administration in Valparaíso).</i> (August 6, 2018)

                    Most Rapa Nui residents recognize that life would be much more difficult on the island without
                    Chile contributing a great deal of money and material resources to sustain the community, which
                    could not grow nearly as large as it has in recent decades (for better or worse). Even Rosa (32)
                    who identifies very strongly as Rapa Nui and expressed negative opinions about allowing so
                    many Chileans to live on the island, said she does not agree with the idea of an independent Rapa
                    Nui, but does like the idea of a Rapa Nui with greater administrative autonomy.

                    Rosa said, “Independence calls for the capacity to...to have everything for ourselves, something
                    we won’t be able to accomplish...(so)... autonomy, yes, but independence no.” (August 8, 2018)

                <p>Maria, a 30-year-old Rapa Nui woman, said to me in a casual conversation about tourism and the
                    independence movement “el turismo nos da de comer (tourism provides for us economically),
                    but that doesn’t mean we should become independent, and it doesn’t mean the tourists aren’t
                    overwhelming at times.” Even if they think independence is unrealistic given the island’s
                    material needs and limited resources, most Rapa Nui residents expressed a desire to see local
                    solutions to local problems, with actual residents making the important decisions regarding the
                    island’s laws and resources, rather than politicians thousands of miles away in Santiago and
                    Valparaíso who have never traveled to the island.

                    Despite the seeming unlikelihood of an independent Rapa Nui, the Rapa Nui Parliament –
                    whom the Chileans and even some Rapa Nui consider to be extremists – have been instrumental
                    in garnering international attention for the historical wrongs committed against the Rapa Nui and
                    the ongoing struggles with the Chilean state over certain land use issues. Indeed, Maria (30), who
                    does not agree with the idea of an independent Rapa Nui, said that if it was not for the
                    “extremists,” making noise, the Rapa Nui would likely not have as much recognition or rights as
                    an indigenous community within the Chilean state:

                        go to other communities or communes on the continent, because
                        everyone works here to maintain their place, not for me to work for
                        them to send the money somewhere else.</i> (July 8, 2018)

                    It was in part thanks to the separatists and their protests that governance of the island’s <a
                        class="location" data-layer-id="park">national park</a> changed hands from Chilean management to
                    Rapa Nui management in 2016
                    (mauhenua.com), the implications of which are not small. The change of management of the
                    park from the Chilean national government to the Ma’u Henua indigenous council (see Figure 13
                    below) provides Rapa Nui residents with greater control of their own land and resources, an
                    opportunity that too many indigenous communities are still deprived of elsewhere, including on
                    the mainland of Chile.

                <div class="caption">Figure 14: LATAM airplane (Chile’s national carrier) seen on the airport runway,
                    with the Chilean flag next to a coconut palm

                    Latin American nation state.</div>
                <p>
                    For better or worse, Rapa Nui has become an integral part of the Chilean state, and the
                    Rapa Nui people have been fairly successful in winning back rights and respect as an indigenous
                    community. Chilean management has allowed for a revival of Rapa Nui culture, alongside the
                    imposition of Chilean culture on the island, with a new culture and identity emerging in the
                    process. Both Chilean and Rapa Nui national identities have left marks in the island’s physical
                    landscape and the two identities mixing is likely to create new landscapes as well. Figure 14
                    above sums up the situation – indigenous Polynesian/Rapa Nui imagery in the form of a thatched
                    roof and coconut palm tree as part of the airport, which was built by Chile, has the Chilean flag
                    displayed, and an airplane of Chile’s national airline, LATAM, which is the only airline that flies
                    to and from the island. The island will always be Polynesian because of its geographic location,
                    climate, flora, volcanic landscape, and the ways of the Rapa Nui people. However, the island is
                    definitely Chilean too, given that many of the residents are Chileans from the mainland, and
                    overall administration, bureaucracy and logistical management is in the hands of the Chilean
                    government, now since 1888.

                <p>
                    It is difficult to say how the tensions between Chileans and Rapa Nui will play out, but
                    there are a lot of potential policy implications. It is apparent that many islanders of both Chilean
                    and Rapa Nui extraction love their island and are stakeholders in the island’s future, and desire
                    greater autonomy while remaining part of the Chilean state. It seems likely though, that as
                    stakeholders in Easter Island’s future, both Chileans and Rapa Nui individuals will continue to
                    build their lives, businesses, and families on this island, continuing to expand and mix Chilean
                    and Rapa Nui cultures. This will undoubtedly leave both Rapa Nui and Chilean imprints in the
                    physical landscape of the island, and a new identity will continue to emerge from the mixing of
                    the two cultures as well.
