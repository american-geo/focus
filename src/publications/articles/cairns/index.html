                <h3>I. To Follow</h3>
                <p>Baking and half-blinded by the summer sun, you squint out at the horizon, searching for anything
                    other than sandstone and sky, an infinity of turquoise-blue arcing over waves of gritty, griddle-hot
                    rock. No sign of life, not even a gnarled shrub. No sign of the trail, either—just air and stone,
                    stretching out beyond the curvature of the earth.</p>
                <p>Your face is redder than the rock, sweat streaming from every pore. You’ve been out in this
                    unforgiving landscape far longer than intended. Even though you’re equipped with hat, water, map,
                    and other essentials, you’re beginning to worry that you’re lost in the labyrinthine Needles
                    District of Canyonlands National Park. Where are you? Why are you even here? Skin and brain burn
                    with anxiety.</p>
                <p>Swallowing the rising panic, you again scan the landscape. Your eye snags on a small pile of
                    rocks—inelegant, unimpressive, but something that stands out as clearly human-made; something
                    telling you that you’re neither lost nor alone; something you can trust for help in this harsh,
                    indifferent place. A cairn! Salvation!</p>
            </section>
            <section id="1b" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp1b" title="To Follow (2)">
                <p>Buoyed by thankfulness, you practically dance over to the stack of stones, and from there on to the
                    next, and next. With wordless encouragement, the cairns guide you across swaths of slickrock,
                    through a tangle of slots, and finally to the base of a soaring fin of sandstone, naturally hollowed
                    by wind, water, and gravity. Aesthetically, the towering, elegant span of Druid Arch is an
                    antithesis to the minute, distinctly human-made jumbles you’ve been following. Experientially,
                    though, the natural landmark and anthropogenic markers are part of the same place. Though you’ve
                    come seeking solitude, your pilgrimage through Canyonlands would not be possible without the
                    companionship of these ordinary yet extraordinary cairns.</p>

                <div class="caption">Figure 1: Cairns inviting hikers through a window into a maze of redrock,
                    Canyonlands National Park, Utah</div>
                <p> “[N]othing,” asserts David Williams, author of Cairns: Messengers in Stone, “is more reassuring than
                    finding a cairn” (2012, 11). The term “cairn” (rooted in the medieval Scottish Gaelic word “carn”,
                    meaning “heap of stones” [Online Etymology Dictionary]) refers to a deliberately-constructed pile of
                    rocks. Used to mark locations, delineate routes, serve as spiritual offerings, and/or merely
                    entertain or amuse, cairns are one of mankind’s most universal and universally-recognizable symbols,
                    present to offer passers-by guidance and hope. Although names and purposes vary worldwide, rock
                    piles share at least three attributes: visually, they stand out from the horizon or surroundings; in
                    so doing, they differentiate otherwise unintelligible space and create distinctive places; and even
                    in the most far-flung and/or wildest locations, they serve as reminders of near-ubiquitous human
                    presence on the planet and stand as testaments to a seemingly innate desire to make our presence
                    known.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, cairns are navigational tools. Worldwide, people trying to move through treeless
                    landscapes such as tundras, deserts, mountain ridges, or shorelines—places where even well-traveled
                    paths may not be well-worn—rely on rock piles to mark safe passage along reliable routes. Cairns
                    prove especially useful in areas that are prone to bad weather—places where fog, rain, and/or snow
                    perpetually disorient travelers or leave them isolated in viewsheds that only extend out a few feet
                    at a time. Basque sheepherders, for example, use “stone boys” (harri mutilak) to demarcate borders
                    and serve as navigational references on foggy days, while Icelandic travelers follow evenly-spaced
                    stone and turf “guardians” (vörður) across stormy highlands (Williams 2012 and Mizin 2013,
                    respectively).</p>
                <p>In addition to their roles as geographic markers or waypoints, cairns can also protect food,
                    clothing, navigational tools, and/or messages. Historically, polar explorers cached food and
                    personal, scientific, and navigational notes in rock piles, while desert wayfarers stored water in
                    the shade of stone structures or used properly-positioned cairns as condensation-catchers. Equally
                    importantly, sturdy rock piles can deter scavengers from reaching human remains, or at least stand
                    as lasting memorials to the dead, best exemplified by elaborate, multichambered, Neolithic and
                    Bronze Ages stone tombs found throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>While they may exist primarily for utilitarian purposes, cairns are often imbued with sociocultural
                    significance and/or steeped in sociocultural lore. Many are believed to provide magical
                    protection—an ability to save people from malevolent spirits, as in the case of Icelandic vörður,
                    and/or to offer healing to travelers, as with Arctic tunillarvik. On a deeper level, some are
                    crucial elements of sacred geography, built to indicate the location for important ceremonies, as do
                    Mongolian sky-spirit “magnificent bundles” (ovoo), or serve as ritual gateways to a spirit world, as
                    with Arctic shamans’ tupqujaq (Williams 2012, 124 and Hallendy 2009, respectively). In some cases,
                    the stones themselves become sacred: for example, the Klamath and Modoc peoples of Oregon and
                    California have such deep reverence for their cairns that they have a taboo against touching or even
                    photographing them (Haynal 2000). More often, holiness or supernatural qualities supplement but do
                    not supersede cairns’ more mundane purposes. For example, piles of old prayer stones in northeastern
                    Tibet are, according to writer and naturalist Craig Childs, “meant for use. Truck drivers…pulled out
                    these…stones and poured them into ruts. Monks had told me this is what they are for, to usher
                    prayers into the world” (2012, 240).</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most widely-recognized, multi-purposed, and enigmatic of stone structures are the
                    inuksuit (singular inuksuk) of Arctic peoples of Alaska, northern Canada, and Greenland. These
                    “person-substitutes” (McNeill 2004) or “things that act for or perform the function of a person”
                    (Hallendy 2009) (the kind depicted on the flag of Nunavut, not the controversial figure used as a
                    logo for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, which was, technically, a human-shaped inunngiiaq
                    [Hallendy 2000; McNeill 2004]) serve multiple purposes, all of which are imbued with deep meaning
                    (Hallendy 2009; Graburn 2004). At their simplest, inuksuit serve as landmarks, erected by Arctic
                    peoples to identify locations and/or biogeophysical features. “They mark trails, delineate spiritual
                    precincts, herd caribou, and locate good hunting and fishing,” writes ethnohistorian Norman
                    Hallendy, adding that they can indicate, among other attributes: snow depth, ice characteristics,
                    safe or dangerous passages across rivers or ice, and polar orientation (2009, 80). Hallendy also
                    describes inuksuit as “material forms of oral tradition” and, even more abstractly, as “a metaphor”,
                    there to “remind [the elders] … of the time when people were attached to the land by an unbroken
                    thread of reverence, when they…placed huge inuksuit on hilltops… and communicated by rearranging or
                    shaping fragments of the landscape” (2000, 23 and 63, respectively.) For Arctic peoples, following
                    an inuksuk is an act of ritual, leading them through both space and time, connecting them to
                    generations of others who’ve found themselves in the same place.</p>
                <p>In a broader sense, to follow any cairn is an act of friendship and faith—a way of moving through a
                    sometimes harsh and unfamiliar world by trusting in others’ wisdom and guidance.</p>

                <h3>II. To Build</h3>
                <p>Shoulders aching, fingers bruised, black flies buzzing in your ears, you pause to survey the stones
                    at your feet—which one has the right mix of flatness and tilt? Breadth and depth? Beauty and
                    substance? You pick one up and feel that it’s wrong even before you put it on the pile—too bulgy.
                    Take two—too big. Not the third or fourth or even the fifth; you’re beginning to consider going on a
                    reconnaissance mission and lugging back more options. But then, a half-dozen tries in, you finally
                    find the near-magic stone that settles perfectly into its spot, completing the second layer of your
                    cairn.</p>
                <p>Satisfied, you step back to appreciate your accomplishment. Although far from finished, you’ve made
                    decent headway—the large, sturdy base should support several more layers. Once complete, the stack
                    will clearly stand out from the otherwise smooth, steep surface. Even in the iciest, foggiest,
                    and/or windiest conditions, it will help hikers find the safe, proper route up to and down from the
                    summit of Wright Peak in upstate New York’s Adirondack State Park. In addition to improving safety,
                    the cairn will help protect the peak’s rare and fragile Arctic-Alpine vegetation. (If visitors know
                    where the trail is, they’ll be more likely to stay on the bare rock face rather than go tromping off
                    across the tundra.) In fact, that’s your main objective—to try to protect the plants atop the
                    heavily-visited mountain.</p>
                <p>That’s not to say you don’t feel pride in your work. You’re fully aware that from this day forth,
                    your cairn will be a fact on the landscape, a waypoint experienced by every hiker. Years hence,
                    you’ll be able to point to it and say: I built that; that’s my legacy. Without having to carve your
                    initials into a tree or peck them out of the bedrock, you’re showing: I was here!</p>

                <p>“Like much rock work,” cairn construction is, according to trails experts with the Appalachian
                    Mountain Club (AMC), “as much an art as a science” (Lentz 2007, 26). Unlike monumental architecture
                    or infrastructure, cairns do not require elaborate equipment or superhuman strength to build—only
                    sweat, patience, an eye for design, and a touch of luck. To be able to withstand the vagaries of
                    weather (and the occasional vandal, or at least individuals who curiously or unknowingly push or
                    prod), cairns must be made up of what Hallendy calls “the perfect balance of stones selected and
                    arranged with great care” (2000, 21).</p>
            </section>
            <section id="2b" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp2b" title="To Build (2)">
                <p>Before beginning the stone-selection and arrangement—the actual construction—cairn-builders must
                    carefully consider sites and sight-lines. Navigational aids must be visible from the neighboring
                    structures so that travelers will be always able to see at least one pile ahead, in either
                    direction. For this to be so, cairns must stand out against the horizon and/or be made of material
                    of a different color, texture, or pattern than the surrounding scene. The placement of
                    non-directional cairns—shrines, burial mounds, or commemorative stacks—must also reflect an
                    understanding of a place’s personal or cultural significance. For example, cairns to which travelers
                    give offerings and pray for safety in treacherous terrain in the Andes are most commonly situated at
                    the crest of a mountain pass or at a trail junction (Jett 1986)—places where people are in greatest
                    need of assistance. Alternatively, Hallendy notes that inuksuit “tend to be plentiful at places were
                    [sic] people have waited… It’s at the waiting places where you can sometimes find…the most beautiful
                    kind of inuksuk” (2000, 27). </p>

                <p>Just as a cairn-builder chooses a location based on a mix of personal, cultural, and environmental
                    factors, they design their pile depending on its purpose, available source material, and local
                    cultural or artistic traditions. There are a few distinctive styles, ranging from Arctic people’s
                    human-like inunngiiaq to Acadia National Park’s iconic “Bates cairns” (two-legged platforms with
                    pointer-rocks, first designed and built by early-20th century trailmaker Waldron Bates). These are
                    exceptions to “tapering piles”—a wide, circular base supporting subsequently smaller-diameter
                    layers—which are, by and large, the most common cairn design worldwide (Williams 2012). Although
                    they are comparatively easy to build, balance, and scale, construction of tapering cairns still
                    requires a great deal of forethought, effort, skill, and patience. The AMC’s Handbook spells out
                    their standards:<q>“Cairns should be … almost as wide at the base as they are high… Large, flat
                        rocks should be used…Use as large stones as possible for the base. Each layer should slope
                        slightly to the center…, so that gravity will stabilize the cairn …Build up successive layers
                        making sure that each joint is bridged by a stone. Each stone should also have at least three
                        points of contact with underlying stones” (Lentz 2007, 26).</q>Only after testing the stability
                    of the cairn—by standing on it, to see whether pieces slide away or the entire form collapses—can a
                    cairn builder’s attention turn to the overall appearance: “you can try putting small stones in gaps
                    for aesthetic reasons,” the AMC manual concedes, and consider “search[ing] for a white rock to place
                    on top…for visibility” (Lentz 2007, 26).</p>

                <p>Intentionally-designed and -built cairns differ in form, function, and construction from heaps that
                    rise organically and communally as travelers, pilgrims, and passers-by add pebbles to a pile. These
                    heaps may serve as navigational landmarks, but, more importantly, are physical manifestations of
                    local history and lore. People add stones to piles as memorials, tokens of respect for spirits or
                    landscape features, or for plain old good luck. For example, a sizeable if haphazard pile has
                    accumulated atop Skylight Peak in the Adirondacks, as generations of hikers have put hope in the
                    superstition that they’ll have better weather if they carry a rock to the summit.</p>

                <div class="caption">Figure 4: Wishes for no rain atop Skylight Peak, Adirondacks</div>
                <p>This “practice of establishing cairn trail shrines to which passers-by add stones” is “extremely
                    widespread”, according to geographer Stephen Jett (1986, 615). In his study of trail shrines
                    specific to the Central Andes—apacheta, a Quechuan term meaning “carrying or having something
                    carried” (Williams 2012, 88) or “burden depositor” (Jett 1994, 5)—Jett finds that people contribute
                    to cairns as an act of prayer. Weary travelers make offerings to apacheta—food items such as maize
                    or coca, cloth, and, especially, stones—to “reduce fatigue and to obtain good luck and protection on
                    [their] journey” (Jett 1994, 1), or, in the words of 16th-century conquistador Pedro Cieza de Leon,
                    to “leave their tiredness behind” (quoted in Jett 1994, 1). Archaeologist Carolyn Dean adds that
                    apacheta are so revered because they’re seen as “embodiments of Andean topography”—sacred mountains
                    made miniature (2015, 93). By adding to the apacheta, travelers form or strengthen a symbiotic
                    relationship with the terrain: they help the apacheta, which means they’re helping the mountains;
                    the mountains, in turn, will smile favorably on them.</p>
                <p>In all cases, building or adding to a cairn can help individuals engender a sense of connection with
                    the world in which they live and through which they move. Williams describes the instinct to add a
                    rock to a trailside mound as “a way to leave a little part of ourselves in the landscape” (2012,
                    23). Likewise, an Inuit interviewee told folklorist Lynne McNeill that “when you put a stone where
                    other people put stones, it's like you're contributing a part of your presence to something that
                    stays behind when you leave” (2004). Zulu people’s relationship with rock piles called Isivivane
                    exemplifies that sense of both membership and contribution. The term “Isivivane” translates to
                    “throw your stone upon the pile”, signifying an act of both honoring the sacred and/or historical
                    sites upon which isivivane appear and participating in a group effort. Passers-by are expected to
                    “pick up a stone, spit on it and place it on the heap of stones” so as to “pay respect to the
                    spirits and so ensure that they have a safe journey” (Pongola Game Reserve, KwaZulu Natal.)</p>
                <p>On a larger level, constructing a cairn is a way for individuals to mark their presence and actively
                    shape the meaning of a place. “‘I was here[!]’” builders announce through their rock-creations; “‘I
                    have something important to say about this place[!]” (McNeill 2004). For Andean travelers, apacheta
                    are a means of participating in an ancient ritual. For Inuit peoples, inuksuit are affirmations of
                    their existence within both a landscape and a culture. For AMC trails crews, cairns are ways to say,
                    Here’s the path—stay on it! For someone laboring away in the Adirondacks, layering on stone after
                    heavy, oddly-shaped stone, each addition says, I care about Wright Peak and want to celebrate and
                    protect it! (Implied: I am part of this place!)</p>

                <p>Lungs and legs burning, you pause to catch your breath and look back across the valley before
                    continuing up to the ridgetop. The view is spectacular—a deep carpet of mosses and grasses stretches
                    off to mingle with darker patches of pine; higher up on the flanks distant ridges, bright grey-blue
                    rock remains exposed; behind the ridges, peak after sharp, furrowed, snow-capped peak, is swallowed
                    up by sky. Somewhere out there, far to the southeast and shrouded in its typical clouds, stands “The
                    High One”—Denali, crown of the North American continent and heart of its namesake National Park. You
                    only know that it’s there because you were fortunate enough see it a week earlier, on the bluebird
                    day when you first clambered up Primrose Ridge. You were so enamored of that experience—including
                    not only a glimpse of Denali, but an encounter with a pair of Dall sheep and one lonely caribou—that
                    you’ve decided to return.</p>
                <p>Although the weather isn’t as cooperative this weekend, you don’t mind the low blanket of clouds and
                    cool mist. You’re happy to wander freely through the trailless, treeless terrain, looking for more
                    sheep or caribou or flowers bursting into bloom; thirsty for any and all bits of wildness, no need
                    for a goal or destination. The higher you climb away from the park road (the only sign of humanity
                    in the otherwise primeval landscape), the more boundless you feel. After all, the ridge is in a
                    federally-designated wilderness—one of the few places on the planet where, as per the Wilderness Act
                    of 1964, “the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man” and where you’re promised
                    “outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation.”</p>
                <p>One last push to the top. Already immersed in the sense of wildness, you’re especially shocked to see
                    them—a dozen or so stones balanced artfully if not a bit jauntily atop an outcrop. This pile is not
                    a friendly guide and definitely not an inuksuk. Is it even a cairn? Or a type of graffiti made of
                    rock? Instead of welcoming or guiding you, it seems antithetical to the idea of wilderness. It does
                    not belong here.</p>

            <section id="3b" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp3b" title="To Dismantle (b)">
                <p>What David Williams calls an “epidemic of stacked stone” is afflicting protected areas around the
                    United States (2012, 109). Although recreational stone-stacking is also increasing in other parts of
                    the world, it’s especially popular in American national and state parks, which have recently seen a
                    proliferation of visitor-built cairn-like sculptures and, with them, a suite of environmental,
                    recreational, and aesthetic impacts. </p>
                <p>At first glance, building a personal cairn or rock sculpture would seem an innocuous or even
                    admirable pursuit—a way for individuals to interact with and deepen their relationship with wild
                    spaces and/or public places. To some people, stone-stacking is “a way of honoring an urgent inner
                    soul demand to be more balanced, quiet, still, and centered” (quoted in Williams 2012, 105), a way
                    to “leave something in the landscape artfully altered” (an editor’s addendum to an essay on “Rock
                    Stacking and the Art of Balance”, Rogers 2013), and/or “part of the human condition… this is humans
                    expressing their bliss” (according to a High Country News reader, “M Pinenut”, response to Martin
                    2015).</p>
                <p>To others, though, erection of personal cairns is an unnecessary, disrespectful, and damaging
                    pursuit. “Stop the rock-stacking[!]” exasperated writer Robyn Martin urged in a High Country News
                    opinion piece (2015), eliciting vehement praise and equally-vehement admonition from more than two
                    hundred agitated readers. Martin lists several problems associated with structures that she
                    dismisses as New Agey “prayer stone stacks” and/or manifestations of selfishness: “First, if [rock
                    stacks are] set in a random place, they can lead an unsuspecting hiker into trouble, away from the
                    trail... Second, we go to wilderness to remove ourselves from the human saturation of our lives, not
                    to see mementoes from other people's lives”; moreover, “[m]oving rocks increases erosion by exposing
                    the soil underneath” and can destroy the burrows of insects or small mammals (Martin 2015). In
                    addition to the social and ecological concerns Martin describes, pseudo-cairns belittle indigenous
                    cultures. When non-Inuit outsiders build inauthentic inuksuit-like structures just for fun, for
                    example, Inuit elders fear that their material culture is being disrespectfully appropriated
                    (McNeill 2004). Similarly, native Hawaiians feel that visitor-built recreational cairns delegitimize
                    traditional native ahu and desecrate sacred places (Hawaiian Volcano Observatory 2005).</p>
                <p>In public parks and preserves, land managers use a mix of education and regulation to try to prevent
                    visitors from illegally tampering with legitimate cairns and/or erecting personal sculptures. For
                    example, in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where stone-stacking visitors were peeling stones off
                    lava flows, “eras[ing] geologic history” and “destroy[ing] important archaeological evidence”,
                    personnel began dismantling new structures, posted “no rock stacking” signs, and issued a news
                    release pleading: “Respect the Land, Honor the Culture, Leave the Rocks in the Rightful Place”
                    (Hawaiian Volcano Observatory 2005). Outreach materials politely explain the difference between
                    legitimate ahu and tourist-built heaps, describe the impacts of improperly-built structures, and
                    sternly inform visitors of a federal law prohibiting “disturbing from its natural state all mineral
                    resources” (Hawaii Volcanoes 2005). Meanwhile, officials at Acadia National Park face a mix of
                    vandals knocking over trail cairns as well as visitors out “pil[ing] rocks on ridgetops and
                    cobblestone beaches, not knowing that violates park rules, or that it may offend others” (Acadia
                    2015). Rangers have spent years trying to find the most effective ways to educate the public and
                    mitigate the damage, but sometimes wonder if “‘[i]t is a waste of our time when somebody is undoing
                    the work that [we] do on a daily basis’” (quoted in Acadia 2015).</p>
                <p>It's not just about the rocks, or even the environmental, cultural, and social impacts of
                    stone-stacking, according to Charlie Jacobi, the former Resource Specialist at Acadia—the larger
                    issue centers on “‘stewardship of public lands and…places we love and go to’” (quoted in Acadia
                    2015). He cites the principles of the “Leave No Trace” Center for Outdoor Ethics, a widely-accepted
                    program that “teaches people…how to enjoy the outdoors responsibly” (LNT n.d.). Most notably, the
                    principle “Leave What You Find” urges outdoor recreationists not to take or alter existing objects
                    or features, or return temporary alterations to pre-use conditions (i.e. disassemble stone
                    sculptures before leaving) to preserve natural and cultural integrity. Put bluntly by Martin: stone
                    stacks are “unnecessary marker[s] of humanity... Pointless cairns are simply pointless reminders of
                    the human ego” (2015).</p>
                <p>“Pointlessness” is at the heart of the dispute. Is stacking stones a universal instinct practiced by
                    peoples worldwide for millennia, a right of self-expression, and/or an emerging aesthetic? Or is
                    piling rocks for no utilitarian or symbolic purpose an exercise in selfishness and disregard for
                    ecological and/or cultural landscapes? Researchers agree that traditionally-built cairns serve as
                    important navigational cues and reflect meaningful environmental perceptions, but where do personal
                    rock sculptures fit in, both figuratively and geographically? Are there places or spaces that aren’t
                    meant to be humanized?</p>

                <p>Atop Primrose Ridge, it may have given someone pleasure to balance some rocks—a sense of engagement,
                    perhaps, with the wide, wondrous landscape, or a way to create a secure, meaningful place out of
                    that sweeping “chaos of natural ‘space’” (McNeill 2004). A small act of defiance; a means of
                    humanizing a decidedly non-human place. Something to do to pass the time while waiting for wildlife,
                    who knows. </p>
                <p>You do know, though, that it gives you a feeling of deep satisfaction and joy to dismantle the
                    structure and gently nestle the stones back into the divots from which they must have come. Within a
                    few minutes, you return the scene to its wild, windswept character—creating your own mental landmark
                    in the process—then continue on your way, guided across the emptiness of the landscape by only your
                    own curiosity and desire. </p>
