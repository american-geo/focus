                    Oil and the Misspent Riches of Equatorial Guinea</h2>
                <div class="author"><span class="name">Thomas A. Wikle</span>, <span class="organization">Oklahoma State
                        University</span></div>
                <div class="citation"><span class="citation-label">DOI:</span> 10.21690/foge/2019.62.7f</div>
                <p>Evidence of prosperity isn’t difficult to find in Equatorial Guinea. Scattered among colonial-era
                    buildings are high-rise office towers, freshly-painted apartment complexes, and ornate government
                    buildings, some lined with marble columns. There are also new hospitals, sports stadiums, four-star
                    hotels, conference centers, and championship golf courses. Older urban areas are linked to new ones
                    through a highway system rivaling those in Europe and the U.S. Everywhere, vacant lots play host to
                    earthmovers, construction cranes, concrete mixers, and piles of building materials. Equatorial
                    Guinea’s expanding infrastructure symbolizes its newfound economic status. Once among the World’s
                    poorest countries, the former Spanish territory boasts the highest per capita gross national product
                    (US $36,270) in Africa (Global Finance 2019). But summary statistics can be misleading. Outside
                    major cities, the landscape appears similar to less developed African countries with the dirt
                    streets of rural villages lined by houses without indoor plumbing. Unemployment and poverty rates
                    are high while literacy and life expectancy are low (Beegle et al. 2016). Lacking access to
                    healthcare and education, a large percentage of the population survives on subsistence agriculture
                    by growing cassava, sweet potato, and bananas. For visitors, the country’s landscape is like a movie
                    set with elaborate façades hiding squalid conditions just beyond view.</p>
                <p>Equatorial Guinea’s urban transformation began 25 years ago when geologists with Mobil Oil (now
                    ExxonMobil) discovered substantial petroleum reserves within the country’s territorial waters. Work
                    soon began on drilling and storage facilities and within two years the country’s offshore fields
                    were producing 80,000 barrels per day (bpd)(Oil and Gas Journal 1998). Oil brought a financial
                    windfall. Between 1997 and 2001 the country’s economy was the fastest growing in the World with
                    foreign reserves increasing from US $40,000 to more than $3.1 billion (Frynas 2004). With new
                    capital, the country’s president and ruling party were positioned to expand healthcare, increase
                    access to education, and implement policies to attract foreign investment. However, in lieu of
                    improving the standard of living, new wealth was directed towards infrastructure projects designed
                    to impress international visitors and provide financial benefits for the President and his family.
                    This article traces Equatorial Guinea’s recent history with a focus on oil revenue and its role in
                    transforming the country’s urban landscapes.</p>

                <h3>An Unlikely Geography</h3>
                <p>Equatorial Guinea isn’t well-known, even among Africans. The country is noteworthy for having the
                    continent’s longest serving head of state and for being Africa’s only nation with Spanish as its
                    official language. Despite having pristine rainforests and abundant wildlife, the country attracts
                    few international tourists. A distinguishing characteristic of Equatorial Guinea is its unlikely
                    international boundary that encircles widely dispersed islands and a small region on Africa’s
                    mainland. Its two largest islands, Bioko and Annobón, are part of the Bonny Islands, a series of
                    volcanic peaks extending from Mt. Cameroon on Africa’s mainland to the southwest across the Gulf of
                    Guinea. Located 40 kilometers west of Cameroon’s Atlantic coastline, Bioko Island has geographic
                    extremes with a high, rugged interior featuring alpine landscapes and a coastline bordered in places
                    by mangrove swamps. Far to the southwest is Annobón Island, located 350 kilometers west of Gabon’s
                    Cape Lopez and separated from Bioko by the island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe. Measuring six by
                    three kilometers, Annobón’s land area is just 18 square kilometers. Named for an estuary of the
                    Utamboni River, the mainland province of Río Muni is bordered to the north by Cameroon and to the
                    south and east by Gabon (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). The mainland region’s 26,017 square
                    kilometers are part of the
                    Congo Basin, Africa’s largest forested area and the World’s second largest tropical rainforest.
                    Including Annobón Island, the country’s geographic boundaries extend from 4˚ north to 2˚ south
                    latitude and from 5˚ to 12˚ east longitude.</p>

                <div class="caption">Figure 1: Equatorial Guinea and Offshore Oil and Gas Areas</div>
                <p>Influenced by its position near the Equator and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Equatorial Guinea’s
                    tropical climate has pronounced wet and dry seasons with temperatures in the country’s capital city
                    of Malabo ranging from 16 to 33˚C. In terms of flora, the landscape is dominated by dense tropical
                    forests that contain more than 140 types of trees including mahogany, ebony, and rubber. For those
                    traveling away from urban areas, the country’s exceptional biodiversity can be seen in animal life
                    that includes dwarf antelope, hippo, elephant, gorilla, and four species of sea turtle.</p>

                <h3>History and Settlement</h3>
                <p>Human occupation of Equatorial Guinea began about 10,000 years ago when early descendants of a Bantu
                    ethnic group known as the Bubi migrated from central Africa to uninhabited Bioko Island (known to
                    the Bubis as Etulá). Early occupants of Río Muni were pygmy and Ndowe peoples who were followed by
                    successive waves of other groups including the Bubi after 1200 and the Fang in the mid-1600s (Lea
                    2001). Like most African nations, the country’s history has been shaped by colonial occupation.
                    Searching for a route to Asia, the Portuguese were first to reach Bioko in 1471 with the island
                    subsequently named Fernando Pó in honor of the expedition’s leader. The first European settlement on
                    Fernando Pó was a Dutch trading post established in 1642. The island was later occupied by the
                    Portuguese who grew sugar cane for export to Europe. During the sixteenth century, Fernando Pó
                    supported operations for transporting slaves captured on the mainland to destinations in the
                    Americas. In 1778, Portugal traded Fernando Pó Island and commercial rights over a mainland region
                    extending between the Ogooué and Niger Rivers to Spain in exchange for territory in Brazil (Brown
                    1895).</p>
                <p>Spain’s first attempt to establish a permanent colony on Fernando Pó was unsuccessful due to threats
                    from disease. Beginning in 1827, the British leased land on the island, establishing an antislavery
                    base at Port Clarence where Malabo stands today (Sundiata 1996). In 1855, Spain reasserted control
                    over Fernando Pó, designating their West African lands, Territorios Españoles del Golfo de Guinea
                    (Spanish Territory of the Gulf of Guinea) and renaming Port Clarence as Santa Isabel in honor of
                    Queen Isabella II. For the next several decades the territory attracted few European settlers with
                    most economic activities focused on palm oil and cocoa production. For a brief period, the island
                    served as a penal colony for Cubans of African descent and by the end of the Spanish-American War
                    (April 21, 1898 to August 13, 1898) the territory was Spain’s last tropical colony.</p>

                <p>By 1900, the economic situation on Fernando Pó showed signs of improvement as profits from cocoa
                    exports began to attract migrants from Spain. A subsequent construction boom was responsible for
                    many colonial-era structures seen today in Malabo including Santa Isabel Cathedral (<a
                        href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>). With
                    much of their attention focused on Fernando Pó, Spanish authorities were slow to pursue economic
                    interests on the mainland. Settlements there were limited to a military garrison at the site of the
                    present-day City of Bata and coastal trading stations at the mouths of major rivers. In 1900, Spain
                    transferred control of more than 300,000 square kilometers on the mainland to France as part of the
                    Treaty of Paris. This left only the 26,017 square kilometer Río Muni region under Spanish control
                    (Roberts 1986).</p>
                <p>In 1926, Spanish holdings in the Gulf of Guinea were formally designated the province of Spanish
                    Guinea with residents receiving rights and privileges equal to other Spaniards. Crops were grown on
                    plantations of up to 2,000 hectares called “fincas.” The next several years were prosperous as a
                    result of cocoa, timber, and coffee exports to European countries, especially Spain, the United
                    Kingdom, and Germany. By 1930, Spanish Guinea was the World’s largest exporter of cocoa. After World
                    War II, the Franco government initiated public works and social welfare programs aimed at making
                    Spanish Guinea a model territory (Payne 1987). However, anticolonial sentiments grew as many pushed
                    to break from Spain. In 1968, Equatorial Guinea became independent and subsequently many colonial
                    names were replaced with African ones. For example, Fernando Pó become Bioko Island and Santa Isabel
                    was renamed Malabo (Alvan, Mas-Coma and Carrasco 1996).</p>
                <p>Having previously served as Santa Isabel’s mayor, Francisco Macias Nguema was elected the country’s
                    first president through a popular vote. Unfortunately, democracy was short-lived. Within a year,
                    Nguema purged the country’s senior leadership and dissolved opposition parties, declaring himself
                    “president for life” (Maass 2005). Imprisonment, torture, and murder became tools for quelling
                    resistance with thousands sent to Malabo’s infamous Black Beach Prison (Fegley 1981). Purges put the
                    economy into a freefall. By 1974, media outlets and most schools had been shut down and basic
                    services such as electricity and telephone communication became intermittent or unreliable. By the
                    time Nguema was overthrown by his nephew, Lt. Colonel Teodoro Obiang, almost a third of the
                    country’s population had been murdered or forced into exile (McSherry 2006).</p>

                <p>Elected to replace Nguema, Teodoro Obiang ended much of the violence but took few steps to advance
                    democracy or restore personal freedoms (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). Prisoners continued to be
                    used as laborers on
                    construction projects while ordinary citizens were subject to searches, extortion payments, and
                    detention at police checkpoints (U.S. Department of State 2002). Although a multiparty system,
                    Obiang’s ruling party and its allies held nearly all seats in the country’s parliament. Fearing
                    challenges from opposition groups, Obaing took measures to consolidate power and safeguard his
                    position, appointing most military officers and police from his hometown and Esangui Clan (African
                    Confidential 2003). Following an attempted coup in 1980, he assumed control of the Supreme Military
                    Council and appointed himself Minister of Defense and Security, Minister of the Economy and
                    Finances, and Minister of Information. In 1982, the country’s constitution was modified to give him
                    the power to make laws by decree and negotiate and ratify treaties.</p>

                <h3>The Newest Persian Gulf</h3>
                <p>Spanish government geologists were first to find evidence of oil deposits in the waters off Bioko
                    Island. However, without a national petroleum company or expertise in deep water drilling, no effort
                    was made to develop oil reserves. Compared to countries with land-based oil production and storage
                    facilities, Equatorial Guinea’s crude oil infrastructure is almost entirely off-shore. The principal
                    production area is the Zafiro Field, located 42 miles northwest of Bioko Island near the coastline
                    of Cameroon (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). In lieu of constructing offshore platforms, engineers
                    at Zafiro use special
                    “Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading” (FPSO) vessels moored directly over wells. Resembling
                    aircraft carriers, FPSOs provide temporary storage before crude oil can be transferred to tankers
                    bound for European, Asian, or American markets (Appel 2012). With oversight provided by the Ministry
                    of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Equatorial Guinea’s oil interests are managed through its national oil
                    company, Nacional de Petróleos de Guinea Equatorial (GEPetrol).</p>
                <p>Oil produced in West Africa offers important advantages over Middle Eastern crude. Along with having
                    a lower Sulphur content, crude oil from the Gulf of Guinea is less viscus, making it easy to pump
                    and store. West Africa is also more geographically accessible to American and West European markets
                    and, compared to the Middle East, there are fewer security issues threatening production. In 2005,
                    oil production at Zafiro reached a record high of 375,000 bpd (Oil and Gas Year 2019). Two years
                    later the government took steps to diversify and expand production through the development of
                    natural gas reserves at the nearby Alba Field. Gas produced at Alba is processed at <a

                        Punta Europa</a> liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant near Malabo’s International Airport. Along
                    with new
                    infrastructure, oil production brought an influx of foreign workers, leading to a housing shortage
                    in Malabo and Bata. To accommodate newcomers, barracks-style housing was constructed for low-skill
                    laborers, shared dormitories for skilled workers, and apartments and houses for managers. To provide
                    greater security, senior company officials were assigned to homes within gated compounds (<a

                <h3>Corruption, Waste, and Prestige Architecture</h3>
                <p>The exact amount of oil revenue drained from government coffers never be known since government
                    spending is a closely guarded secret (Basedan and Lacher 2006). At least some has directly
                    benefitted the president and his family as demonstrated by a lavish presidential palace covering
                    twelve city blocks of downtown Malabo. Several smaller palaces can also be found in the cities of
                    Luba, Bata, Mbini, Evinayong, Micomiseng, and Moka. The President himself has a 90 meter-long “super
                    yacht,” a US $55 million Boeing 737 aircraft equipped with gold-plated restroom fixtures and a US
                    $2.6 million mansion outside of Washington, DC. His son and heir-apparent Teodorin, owns a mansion
                    in Malibu, California and a collection of sports cars (Vines 2009). A few U.S. companies have played
                    a role in hiding of Equatorial Guinea’s oil riches. In 2004, it was revealed that Washington
                    DC-based Riggs Bank assisted with laundering more than US $700 million for Obiang and his family
                    (Obrien 2004).</p>
                <p>Most conspicuous has been the impact of oil revenue in reshaping urban landscapes of Malabo and Bata.
                    Prestige architecture is part of the President’s plan to impress visitors and rebrand the country’s
                    international reputation. Hundreds of contracts were awarded to international companies to build
                    apartments, high-rise buildings, government offices, roads, bridges, power plants, and port
                    facilitates (<a class="location" data-layer-id="fig5">Figure 5</a>). In lieu of using local labor,
                    most construction
                    jobs have gone to foreign
                    workers, many coming from China, Mali, and Senegal. Examples of prestige buildings include the
                    Sede-Edificio de Tesoro (National Treasury) Building and high-rise structures such as the 11-story
                    Hotel Anda China and 14-story GEPetrol Tower (<a class="location" data-layer-id="fig6">Figure
                        6</a>). At Malabo’s
                    international airport a new
                    glass and steel terminal serves the increase in traffic, with some passengers arriving on direct
                    flights from Houston, Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid, and Zurich. Along with a special terminal for VIPs,
                    the airport has added a 3,048 meter long runway that can accommodate Boeing 747 aircraft. Other
                    capital projects include a 15,000 seat sport stadium in Malabo, a 36,000 seat sports complex in
                    Bata, and the Malabo campus of the National University of Equatorial Guinea. Designed by a Spanish
                    architectural firm, Malabo’s National Theater of Equatorial Guinea resembles a crescent-shaped moon
                    when viewed from above. New utility systems have also been built. For example, a gas-fired power
                    plant on Bioko Island contributes to a national power grid maintained by Segesa, the state-owned
                    power company.</p>

                <p>Equatorial Guinea’s largest and most conspicuous “prestige” project is its 2,280 kilometer highway
                    (<a class="location" data-layer-id="fig7">Figure 7</a>). With up to six lanes in cities such as
                    Malabo, the system
                    encircles Bioko Island. On
                    most days the four-lane expressway connecting Bata with border areas adjacent to Cameroon and Gabon
                    is devoid of vehicles. Projects in outlying areas include a US $12 million seaport facility on
                    Annobón Island that serves large tonnage ships and passenger ferries. Infrastructure projects are
                    part of Obiang’s “Horizon 2020 Development Plan,” that has funneled financial benefits to his family
                    through their partial ownership of companies holding monopolies over building materials.</p>

                <p>Another project designed to showcase the country’s modernization is Malabo II, carved out of
                    second-growth rainforest and cocoa plantations along the coastline east of Malabo and protected by
                    its own police force. Completed at a cost of more than US $830 million, the city is built around a
                    large conference facility called the Sipopo Congress Center built to host the 2011 African Union
                    Summit (Human Rights Watch 2011). Designed by a Turkish architectural firm, the Center resembles a
                    large glass box surrounded by colorful aluminum screens (<a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="fig8">Figure
                        8</a>). Inside
                    the 13,750 square meter
                    building are three large meeting halls and a restaurant. Also impressive is the Medical Center La
                    Paz which includes a 156 bed hospital and adjacent hotel for the families of patients. The hospital
                    remains underutilized because ordinary citizens are not permitted to use it. As a means of
                    encouraging additional construction, large companies doing business in Equatorial Guinea must agree
                    to construct at least one “prestigious building” in Malabo II (Diouf and Fredericks 2014). An
                    example is Noble Energy’s office and apartment complex that features basketball and tennis courts
                    and its own power generation and water treatment systems. Other new buildings in Malabo II include
                    offices for Sonagas, the state-owned natural gas company and buildings for Africa 24 (news agency)
                    and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Most ostentatious are the city’s 52 identical
                    presidential palaces, constructed for each African head of state in advance of the 2011 Summit. Each
                    palace complex includes a presidential mansion and adjacent administrative building. Today, most are
                    empty. Not far from Malabo II is the resort town of Sipopo and elegant Sofitel Hotel featuring an

                <h3>Ciudad de la Paz – Africa’s Brasilia</h3>
                <p>Obiang’s most recent initiative has drawn even more criticism as being wasteful and unnecessary.
                    After spending millions of petrodollars on government buildings in Malabo and Malabo II, the
                    President rolled out plans for a new capital city. Named <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="ciudad">Ciudad de la Paz</a> (also called Oyala and
                    Djibloho), the city is 172 kilometers from Río Muni’s Atlantic coast, near the President’s hometown
                    in eastern Río Muni. Having survived several coup attempts including one seaborne assault, Obiang
                    justifies the new city as necessary for protecting himself and his government. Ciudad de la Paz is
                    entirely carved out of rainforest, drawing comparisons to other planned capital cities such as
                    Nigeria’s Abuja and Brazil’s Brasilia.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="6b" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp5b" title="Ciudad de la Paz – Africa’s Brasilia (b)">
                <p>Infrastructure to support the city’s projected 200,000 residents includes a Chinese built
                    hydroelectric plant and twin 500 meter suspension bridges crossing the Wele River. The city’s
                    principal streets are the Av de la Paz (Avenue of Peace) and the 81-meter wide Av de la Justica
                    (Avenue of Justice), inspired by the expansive Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris. Plans call for a
                    presidential palace, parliament building, opera house, cathedral, conference center, five-star
                    hotel, and golf course. Space has also been assigned for foreign embassies and high and low rent
                    apartment buildings. Now under construction, the new American University of Central Africa will
                    offer courses in English, Spanish and French for students pursuing degrees in architecture, law,
                    business, petroleum engineering, and medicine. Visitors can drive to the city using the highway
                    system or fly into a new international airport located in the nearby city of Mongomeyen. Projected
                    to be completed in 2020, Ciudad del la Paz’s construction costs consumed half of all government
                    spending in 2018. Along with its high cost, the city has attracted attention from environmentalists
                    concerned about the destruction of rainforest lands and impact to biodiversity.</p>

                <div id="figure10" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/fig10.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption">Figure 10: Village near Malabo. Photo by Thomas Wikle.</div>
                <p>Forming a sharp contrast with office towers and luxury apartment buildings of Malabo and Bata are
                    living conditions outside urban areas. Surviving on subsistence agriculture, much of the rural
                    population lives in makeshift houses constructed from mud, thatch, and discarded materials (<a
                        href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>). Nearly half of Equatorial Guineans are without access to safe
                    drinking water and only one in
                    four newborns are immunized for polio and the measles (Apple 2012b). Despite a windfall provided by
                    the country’s oil production, spending on health care remains low. With long waiting times,
                    hospitals lack basic medical supplies and operate without properly trained staff. Most visits for
                    medical services must be paid in advance. Support for public education hasn’t fared well either with
                    high teacher to student ratios and poorly maintained school facilities. Nearly half of students
                    don’t complete primary school and less than 25% advance to middle school. The poor quality of public
                    education has prompted families to send children to private schools if they have the financial
                    means. With most living without electricity or potable water, the country’s poverty rate stands at
                    77 percent (Vines 2009).</p>
                <p>Despite its importance to the country’s gross domestic product, oil hasn’t provided many jobs since
                    drilling and production are capital rather than labor intensive. Although opportunities are better
                    in larger cities, the country’s petroleum industry employs few local residents with most jobs going
                    to skilled expatriates. Even low paying positions can be difficult to find with drivers, security
                    guards, and other unskilled positions distributed through “job agencies” controlled by the
                    President’s associates (Waiafe-Amoako 2017). To be hired, workers must belong to the President’s
                    political party and may be required to contribute some of their pay to the hiring agency.</p>
                <p>Economist characterize a situation where new wealth fails to translate into improvements in the
                    standard of living of most persons as a “paradox of plenty” or “resource curse” (Karl 1997; Auty
                    2001). Countries inflicted by the curse experience rapid revenue growth through extractive
                    industries that leads to waste, inflation, and corruption. An often-cited example of the curse is an
                    oil boom within the Netherlands during the 1970s that contributed to widespread inflation, declines
                    in the production of manufactured goods, and high levels of unemployment. Subsequent economic
                    downturns affecting oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Nigeria have been dubbed
                    “Dutch Disease” (McSherry 2006).</p>

                    Thomas Wikle.</div>
                <p>A byproduct of the curse is that highly profitable sectors of an economy can undercut the development
                    of other industries. For example, when Spanish Guinea became independent in 1968, cocoa production
                    accounted for 75% of the country’s GDP. Within five years of oil being discovered, cocoa production
                    fell 30% (McSherry 2006). Today, only 8% of the country’s land area is used to support the
                    agriculture sector with nearly all basic foodstuffs imported from other countries. Besides
                    petroleum, the country’s major exports include lumber, acyclic alcohols, and wood veneer (OEC 2019).
                    In lieu of contracts going to owned local lumber companies, most logging is done by foreign firms
                    that often overexploit forest resources (<a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>).</p>
            </section>
            <section id="8" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp7" title="The Need for a Diversified Economy">
                <h3>The Need for a Diversified Economy</h3>
                <p>With Equatorial Guinea’s energy sector dwarfing all other industries, there is a justifiable concern
                    over what the future may bring. Beginning in 2004, production at the Zafiro Field began a steady
                    decline with projections calling for an average of 110,000 bpd being produced between 2018 and 2024
                    (Rascouet 2018). Given that Equatorial Guinea’s oil reserves are projected to be exhausted by 2035,
                    the development of a dynamic and diversified non-petroleum economy is of paramount importance.
                    Fortunately, the country is endowed with a diverse range of resources including fertile soils, deep
                    water ports, and a large reserve of labor. Coffee and cocoa are still grown but production is a
                    fraction of what it was 50 years ago. The country continues to export forest products and has
                    initiated replanting programs to ensure sustainability. There are also commercially important
                    minerals that could be exploited including copper, bauxite, lead, phosphates, iron, zinc, gold, and
                    diamonds. Another potential area for investment is the country’s commercial fishing industry which
                    is capable of exporting tuna, perch, cod, pike, shark, and crayfish. Presently, industrial
                    capabilities are modest and limited to saw mills and a few plants that produce cement or bleach. A
                    few wholesale and retail operations can be found including factorías managed by Spanish owners.
                    Unfortunately, graft, corruption, and nepotism contribute to an unstable business climate that
                    discourages outside investment. Other problems include property rights that are selectively enforced
                    and cumbersome policies and procedures that create challenges for operating businesses.</p>
                <h3>Sustainable Ecotourism</h3>
                <div id="figure12" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/fig12.jpg);"></div>

                    Thomas Wikle.</div>
                <p>Given the country’s exceptional biodiversity, ecotourism offers a possibility for diversifying
                    Equatorial Guinea’s economic situation. Unfortunately, the country’s environmental record is
                    checkered with longstanding issues that include deforestation, water pollution, and desertification
                    (Fa 1992). During the 1980s, Obiang signed agreements with British and U.S. companies for dumping
                    toxic wastes on and adjacent to Annobón Island. However, following the discovery of oil he took
                    steps towards protecting the natural environment and developing tourism by creating protected areas
                    that now encompass 19% of the country’s land area. A new federal agency was also created to manage
                    protected areas, called the Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Forest y Manejo del Sistema de Áreas
                    Protegodas (National Forest Development Institute and Management of the Protected Areas System).
                    Today, the list of protected areas includes three national parks: <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="park2">Monte Alen</a> and <a class="location" data-layer-id="park3">Altos de
                        Nsork
                        National Parks</a> on the mainland and <a class="location" data-layer-id="park">Pico Basilé
                        National
                        Park</a> in the northern part of Bioko Island
                    (<a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>). There are also two national monuments and two scientific areas.
                    Located within an
                    hour’s drive from Bata, Monte Alen’s 1400 square kilometers provides habitat for more than 100
                    mammal species including elephant, gorilla, and chimpanzee. Despite receiving federal protection,
                    Equatorial Guinea’s natural areas are subject to significant threats, especially roadbuilding that
                    has enabled logging operations to push deeply into protected areas (<a href="#figure13">Figure
                        13</a>).</p>
                <div id="figure13" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/fig13.jpg);"></div>

                    Thomas Wikle.</div>
                <p>Another problem has been the expansion of illegal hunting that takes place despite a 2007
                    presidential decree banning the consumption of bush meat. Bush meat is a symbol of wealth and a
                    delicacy often preferred over chicken and pork. Animals taken by commercial bush meat hunters
                    include the blue duiker, pangolin, porcupine, and mandrill. On Bioko Island, the bright orange and
                    maroon colors of the red colobus monkey make it an easy target for hunters. Forested areas have also
                    been impacted by the construction of hydroelectric dams and power lines. At Monte Alen National
                    Park, an anticipated increase in ecotourism has yet to materialize and today, the park’s dilapidated
                    lodge has fallen into disuse (<a href="#figure14">Figure 14</a>). Guides continue leading visitors
                    into the park’s forested
                    areas but overhunting makes it rare to see chimpanzee or other larger primates. Another barrier to
                    expanding ecotourism is a requirement for most foreigners (except US citizens) to obtain a visa.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Not long ago, Equatorial Guinea was little-known backwater with a dismal human rights record. Despite
                    having pristine beaches and exceptional biodiversity, the country drew few international visitors.
                    With a struggling economy, the country exported little outside of a few agricultural products.
                    Virtually overnight, the situation changed with billions of petrodollars raising the country’s per
                    capita gross domestic product to a level matching developed countries such as Italy. But rather than
                    make investments in social welfare, oil revenue was laundered through overseas banks or funneled
                    towards infrastructure projects designed to enhance the country’s international standing and
                    reputation. In total, nearly 80% of the country’s oil income was siphoned-off for personal use or
                    spent on building projects, many with limited social value. As an additional measure, many firms
                    doing business in Equatorial Guinea such as banks, oil companies, and international hotel chains
                    were pressured into constructing their own “prestige” buildings. Unsatisfied with the country’s two
                    major urban areas, the President commissioned new cities, carved out of plantation lands and
                    rainforest. Today, there are two Equatorial Guineas. One has gleaming office towers, lavish hotels,
                    and stately government buildings that convey a sense of progress and hope. But another lurks in the
                    shadows and along edges of the former. Most of the country’s citizens are here, living much as they
                    did before the discovery of oil.</p>
