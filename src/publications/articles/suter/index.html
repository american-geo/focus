                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Our journey began on a sleeper train rattling along the ~2,360 km (1,466 miles) railroad from Moscow
                    to the West-Siberian Arctic. The vast tundra landscape was framed in the West by the Ural
                    Mountains, which
                    rose out of the surrounding shrubs and glowed faintly in the 24-hour light of the Arctic summer.
                    During our 40-hour journey, it was impossible to miss the skeletons of old buildings, warehouses,
                    and other signs of large-scale human development dotting the landscape. Old decaying utility poles
                    stood at varying heights and angles as they slowly sunk into the tundra, directly next to
                    contemporary replacements still securely anchored in the permafrost below (Figures <a href="#figure1a">1a,
                    </a><a href="#figure1b">1b</a>).</p>
                <div id="figure1a" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/fig1a.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption"><a class="location" data-layer-id="fig1">Figure 1</a>:(A) railroads, buildings,
                    and high-voltage powerlines – were commonplace in the landscape, alongside abandoned
                    infrastructure, </div>
                <div id="figure1b" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/fig1b.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption">(B) against the backdrop of the Ural Mountains. Photo by: Luis Suter</div>
                <p>As the train halted for one of the many stops, all the passengers piled outside. A group of
                    shift-workers coming from the oil fields waited for the train heading south; a shipment of pipeline
                    segments lay next to the platform, waiting to go north. Some passengers visited a small shop
                    located next to the station, stocking up on ice-cream, beer, and snacks for the journey ahead.
                    Others took their bags and started down a small road running perpendicular to the train tracks.
                    This stop was also special because it marked our official entrance into Siberia. As indicated on
                    the bright signage on an old station house (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>), we were on the
                    continental divide between Europe and Asia, on the crest of the Ural Mountains.</p>

                <div class="caption"><a class="location" data-layer-id="fig2">Figure 2</a>: A stop on the route from
                    Moscow to Labytnangi sat directly on the continental divide of Europe and Asia, in the Ural

                <h3>Labytnangi and Salekhard</h3>
                <p>We finally arrived at our destination, only a few kilometers drive and ferry ride across the Ob
                    River from the regional capital of Salekhard. The railroad
                    ends in the <a class="location" data-layer-id="fig3">city of Labytnangi</a>, with a population
                    ~25,000. There is no bridge across the Ob, which is nearly 2km
                    wide between the cities; only ferries in the summer and an ice-road in the winter. As is typical of
                    the Russian Arctic,
                    Labytnangi is highly urbanized, with buildings densely clustered and perched on stilt foundations
                    anchored deep into the permafrost. There is no bridge across the Ob, which is nearly 2km
                    wide between the cities; only ferries in the summer and an ice-road in the winter. Buildings are
                    connected by small above-ground pipelines
                    carrying water, gas, and communications lines. These adaptations are a purposeful design, meant to
                    isolate the latent heat of infrastructure from thawing the permafrost below and destabilizing the
                    structures (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). Such engineering adaptations are typical of the
                    Russian North, which has a history of large-scale human development in the Arctic dating back
                    several centuries. </p>

                <div class="caption"><a class="location" data-layer-id="fig3">Figure 3</a>: Buildings are set on stilts
                    and utilities like hot-water are piped through raised pipelines, all in order to insulate the heat
                    generated by infrastructure from the permafrost below. Photo by: Ulyana Spack (Moscow State
                    University, Department of Geography)</div>
                <p>Many areas of Labytnangi showed evidence of recent construction, a sign of the economic prosperity
                    from large oil & gas developments that has benefited the region, Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug
                    (YNAO). Nearby, Salekhard is the major city and capital of the oil & gas rich YNAO. Salekhard has
                    been labeled a ‘crown jewel’ of the Russian Arctic and is one of the richest cities in Russia per
                    capita. The
                    city has only recently been given the status of capital, and since then has been transforming its
                    built environment to live up to that status, with numerous modern buildings, facilities, and plenty
                    of construction. Gazprom, the Russian State-Owned natural gas producer, is highly active
                    in the region and recently opened an LNG export terminal on the Peninsula, connecting the vast
                    resource reserves of YNAO to global markets. Salekhard, as capital of the region, has profited and
                    transformed from this strong economic driver for development. </p>

                <h3>Vorkuta</h3>
                <p>After a few short weeks in Salekhard, our team boarded another train and headed towards Vorkuta,
                    only ~130 kilometers away, as the crow flies. The journey to this city took us back across the
                    crest of
                    the Ural Mountains, the natural land-border between Europe and Asia, and into the Komi Republic.
                    Vorkuta sits within this administrative region, in the coal-rich Pechora Basin. Upon arrival, the
                    city looked grim, full of empty and deteriorating shells of buildings. As little as 50 years ago,
                    Vorkuta was an economic powerhouse, sitting at the center of a web of 16 highly productive coal
                    mines supplying the Soviet Union with a much-needed energy resource. The supply of coal from
                    Vorkuta was critical during World War II, and the ciy became a symbol of Soviet industrial power.</p>

                <p>Today, with that resource no longer in demand, the city has faced hard times. Vorkuta, an important
                    regional hub, and once a city of over 200,000, has declined to 60,000 population, and it is
                    struggling to maintain its services. While the urban core of the city contained architectural hints
                    of the city’s past glory, the harsh reality of crumbling infrastructure was omnipresent.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>On the surface, these cities represent complete opposites: <a class="location" data-layer-id="salekhard">Salekhard</a>
                    is a prosperous and growing hub, while <a class="location" data-layer-id="vorkuta">Vorkuta</a> is
                    poorer and declining. Yet, these two cities have a long and comparable history. Each city has
                    experienced periods of explosive growth and also decline related to strategic and resource based
                    economic development known as “boom-bust cycles.” (Barenberg, 2014; Heleniak, 2013; Shiklomanov, et
                    al. 2017). Their experience of dynamic cycles’ economic and demographic changes, however, have come
                    at different moments. When viewed historically, the similarities between these neighboring cities
                    development trends become clear, and a comparison yields insights based past economic policy &
                    urban planning that might prevent future blunders.</p>
                <p>I argue that urban growth and development plans should be adapted to take into consideration the
                    eventuality that currently growing boom-bust cities will shrink (Hollander et al., 2009). That
                    realization requires encouraging alternative approaches to promoting economic prosperity, ones
                    focused on building capacity for local innovation comparatively independent of national or global
                    economic forces (Petrov, 2016; Zamyatina & Pilyasov, 2016). We first offer a historical comparison
                    between the cities and to provide context for how the cities reached their current contrasting
                    states. Then, the cities’ current socioeconomic and demographic states are contrasted using
                    statistical indicators adapted from the Arctic PIRE Urban Sustainability Index (Suter et al. 2017).
                    The paper concludes with a short discussion of the cities’ current and future challenges as well as
                    recommended materials for further reading on the topic.</p>

                <h3>Early Growth: 1595 - 1950</h3>
                <p>Salekhard has hosted a human presence for many centuries. It was originally founded by Russian
                    settlers as a small town called Obdorsk, on the Ob River (<a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>). The
                    small outpost was established in 1595 following the Cossack conquest of Siberia (Russia, IC 2018).
                    Prisoners were exiled there first under tsars times and again after the October Revolution and the
                    formation of the Soviet Union. Notable religious leaders such as Archbishops Procopius (Titov) and
                    Ambrose (Polyansky) of the Russian Orthodox Church were exiled to Salekhard in the early 20th
                    century (Russia IC, 2018; Wood et al., 1989). When the region was reorganized into the Yamal
                    National District in the 1930s, the village was given city status and renamed Salekhard. Around
                    this time, the idea of using forced labor to colonize and develop remote regions of the Northern
                    Territories was discussed among high-level state and party officials, something that was soon be
                    developed into the Stalin’s network of forced-labor camps – often referred to as the GULAG system
                    (Barenberg, 2014, 17).</p>
                <p>In 1930, the geologist Georgii Chernov discovered a seam of high-quality coal on the banks of the
                    Vorkuta River (<a href="#figure8b">Figure 8b</a>). In 1931, the first GULAG camp was established
                    nearby on the banks of the Vorkuta River, referred to as the ‘Usa Section’ of the existing
                    Ukhtpechlag. The initial mining camp housed several thousand prisoners and received hundreds more
                    each summer. Nevertheless, its population remained static because the dangerous work and extremely
                    harsh conditions resulted in a high mortality rate (Barenberg 2014, 20-24). Between 1937 and 1938
                    there were several mass operations within the Soviet Union, during which people labeled as
                    “Anti-Soviet elements” within society were systematically arrested and imprisoned. These operations
                    would come to be known as the “Great Terror,” and resulted in huge increases of the prison
                    populations of Vorkuta. By 1939, the total population of Salekhard was 12,800 (Soldatov et al.,
                    2017) and in Vorkuta the prisoner population alone was at 16,096 (Barenberg 2014, 29).</p>
                <p>The strategic demands of World War II accelerated the expansion of Vorkuta, whose mines Stalin
                    recognized as vital to fueling the war effort. These strategic concerns led to massive increases in
                    coal production in the mid-1940s, with production more than doubling between 1942 and 1943. In this
                    same year, the state-run coal mining company Vorkutaugol was incorporated and the city became a
                    company town as well as a prison camp. It drew a non-prisoner population of engineers, managers,
                    and other skilled laborers drawn to relocate by promises of high-wages, spacious living-quarters,
                    and secure jobs. Coal production rose during the war and post-war years. By 1949, the mines around
                    Vorkuta were producing 5.715 million tons of coal annually. To meet these labor demands, many more
                    prisoners were sent to Vorkuta, reaching a total of 60,519 in 1947. These laborers were accompanied
                    by 35,549 non-prisoner population (Barenberg 2014),giving a total population of nearly 100,000 by
                    the end of the decade. Vorkuta virtually sprang out of the tundra in less than 20 years and became
                    a crucial provider of one of Russia’s most important resources (<a href="#figure8c">Figure 8c</a>).</p>

                <p>Salekhard became the center for another ambitious Soviet infrastrucrure mega-project, called the
                    “Transpolar Mainline.” Originally planned to run from Chum to Novy Port, where a new naval facility
                    was planned, construction began, but then its site was found unfit because of the depth of its
                    bay– The alternate solution was intended to stretch 1,297 km from Salekhard to Igarka, connecting
                    these cities to the railhead of the Russian Rail network (<a href="#figure9a">Figure 9a</a>). This
                    would allow for the
                    efficient transport of valuable metal resources from Norilsk, via the Yenisei River, and projected
                    Soviet power across northern Siberia (Mote, 2003). To achieve this goal, a labor detail called the
                    “501st company” began construction eastward from Salekhard, with around 50,000 prison-laborers
                    deployed there by 1949 (GULAG Online, 2018). Over the course of construction, tens of thousands
                    died due to the harsh conditions. Winters were bitterly cold and the annual thaw turned the tundra
                    into a mosquito infested swamp (<a href="#figure9b">Figure 9b</a>). This railroad project was
                    typical of Soviet development,
                    characterized by megaprojects and centralized planning without much regard to local conditions. The
                    legacy and impact of Stalin’s Arctic ambitions, manufactured with conscripted labor, manifested
                    directly into the future of both Vorkuta and Salekhard.</p>

                <h3>The Late-Soviet Arctic: 1950 - 1991</h3>
                <p>The GULAG system was gradually dismantled following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and with it
                    went the factors driving the development of Vorkuta and Salekhard. Released prisoners were faced
                    restrictions on where they could move, and many settled in their former places of internment
                    (Josephson, 2014). In Salekhard, construction on the Transpolar Mainline was immediately halted
                    following Stalin’s death, with officials citing massive cost overruns (GULAG Online, 2018). By the
                    1960s the railway was primarily used to maintain the utility lines that ran alongside it. Following
                    an initial population decline after the closure of the GULAG, Salekhard’s population began to
                    recover slowly, increasing from 16,567 to 19,000 between 1959 and 1967 (Soldatov et al., 2009). It
                    was not until the 1970s and 1980s, when oil and gas were discovered on the Yamal Peninsula, that
                    this city would see explosive growth. Between 1970 and 1989, the city’s population grew by almost
                    50%, from 21,929 to 32,334. The discovery of the Bovanenkovo gas field, as well as several other
                    oil and gas fields (<a href="#figure10"></a>Figure 10</a>) spurred interest in further exploration
                    within the Yamal-Nenets
                    region (Kontorovich, 2015). Throughout this time, however, Yamal-Nenets was considered part of
                    Tyumen Oblast and much of the natural wealth of the region flowed south to Tyumen, the capital.</p>

                <p>Vorkuta’s experience following the phase-out of the GULAG system was much more turbulent. Its
                    non-prisoners population had steadily increased, and at the time of Stalin’s death almost equalled
                    its prison population (Barenberg 2014). By 1950, a children's hospital was built to serve the
                    growing young population, prisoners began earning a small wage, and there were increased
                    interactions between prisoners and non-prisoners . Loosening regulations ended the segregation
                    between prisoner and non-prisoner populations. In 1956, 29% of the total prison population lived
                    outside the camp walls and many began to earn some pay for their labor (Barenberg 2014, 154). Over
                    a five-year period, 105,000 prisoners were released altogether (Barenberg 2014, 162). Some moved
                    south, but many more stayed, transitioning from life as a prisoner to their new roles in the
                    flourishing Soviet ‘company town’ (<a href="#figure11a">Figure 11a</a>).</p>

                    the urban landscape was dominated by the surrounding mines and tailings piles.</div>
                <p>With the seemingly limitless labor force of the GULAG camps gone, Vorkuta had to attract new
                    populations. The promises of high-wages, secure work, and large apartments were used to lure
                    engineers and other skilled workers to the mines. The 1960-1980s saw significant growth in Vorkuta,
                    with the population expanding to well over 200,000 (Barenberg, 2014). The city worked quickly to
                    house this booming population; the first modern prefabricated buildings went up in 1962. These
                    structures would come to dominate the urban landscape of the city alongside the older neoclassical
                    buildings of the Stalin era (<a href="#figure12b">Figure 12</a>); many still standing today. The
                    mines were modernized, and
                    rising production continued to push the physical expansion of Vorkuta. Throughout the 1970s, the
                    mines produced about 20 million tons of coal a year, approximately double that of 1953. During this
                    boom, Vorkuta represented the ideal of Soviet urban planning in the Arctic. </p>

                <p>In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed, undoing the political stability that supported many northern
                    cities, including Vorkuta. The collapse of the centralized state meant no more subsidies for
                    workers, the privatization of many industries, and evaporation of workers savings due to
                    hyperinflation (Barenberg 2014). Nor could the State find willing investors to buy the coal mines
                    which had fueled Vorkuta’s economy. The high costs of unsubsidized production in the Arctic made
                    the investment unattractive to actors in the free market (Barenberg 2014). The 1990s were
                    characterized by numerous strikes and work stoppages as workers protested the economic decline and
                    rampant non-payment of wages. The state-owned mining corporation, Vorkutaugol, partnered with the
                    World Bank to streamline its operations. Many mines were deemed unprofitable and were closed during
                    the 1990s, with the satellite cites that served them often abandoned completely (<a href="#figure13">Figure
                        13</a>). By the
                    mid-2000s only six of the thirteen mines that had been active in 1991 remained operational.</p>

                <p>Those who were able to leave migrated south, and the population of Vorkuta and its satellite cities
                    plummeted to 134,200 by 2002. Many experts predicted that the city would disappear entirely within
                    several years (Barenberg, 2014, 239). In 2003, Vorkuta’s mines were purchased by the international
                    steel-conglomerate Severstal. Though this purchase prompted some economic hope, it did not herald
                    the repopulation of the city. Production rebounded, but the process was increasingly automated and
                    required fewer workers. The city had been planned to serve upwards of 300,000 people (Vorkuta City
                    Planning Office, 2017), and it now served a population less than half of that. After decades of
                    intensive expansion this city faced painful contractions and an austere budget. How Vorkuta
                    continues to address the challenge of shrinking will be critical for its long-term future.</p>
                <p>In 2016, there were about 30,301 employees working in Vorkuta, a 37,530 drop from that of 2008
                    (FSSS, 2018). The number of employees in the mining sector dropped from 9,037 in 2008 to just 6,536
                    in 2012, which was the last year that records were made available in this sector (FSSS, 2018). High
                    paying mining jobs employed 24% of Vorkuta’s workers in 2008 and decreased to 15% in 2012. As mine
                    layoffs forced many miners and their families to find alternate positions, Vorkuta saw a small
                    spike in the number of total workers. The combined construction and transport sectors employed 14%
                    of workers in 2008 but spiked to 40% in 2012. This transition was indicative of Vorkuta’s new role
                    as a transport hub for shift-workers of the northern oil and gas fields (Orttung et al., 2016) but
                    was also buoyed by huge increases in the federal subsidies to the local budget in 2012 and 2013
                    (FSSS, 2018). However, these subsidies soon disappeared, and with them, the employment numbers
                    collapsed, falling ~20% just between 2012 and 2014. These factors indicate that Vorkuta is still
                    very much a single-industry city (Zamyatina & Pilyasov, 2016), with the secondary economy highly
                    dependent on the production of coal. Efforts to diversify, such as the modernization of a
                    vocational college, were all still focused solely on coal mining. Public support for the
                    alternative economy – which has been found to be important to promoting a city’s sustainability
                    (Petrov, 2016) – remained relatively weak. </p>
                <p> In Salekhard, some of the economic troubles following the collapse of the USSR were partially
                    mitigated by the influx of private investment and continued state support of the natural gas
                    industry. Gazprom, Russia’s largest gas producer, had been founded only two years before the
                    collapse, in 1989. In 1992, the region became an Autonomous Okrug and gained independence from the
                    Tyumen Region, with Salekhard named the regional capital. Much of the wealth that had flowed south
                    to Tyumen now remained in Salekhard, where the regional administrative and corporate headquarters
                    were located. Though Salekhard saw a slight dip in population between 1991 and 1996, its growth
                    soared in the 2000s, with rising oil and gas prices transforming the city into one of the richest
                    in Russia. This massive economic boom attracted migrants from around Russia and Central Asia to
                    work in the gas-fields and secondary economy (Laruelle, 2013).</p>
                <p>Salekhard’s economy has always been much more diverse than Vorkuta’s, and the city serves several
                    functions. Even before the gas boom, the city functioned as a fishery, trading post for indigenous
                    goods, transportation hub, and administrative center. This multifaceted economy is still very
                    evident today. In 2012, the earliest year for which records were available, the sectors of public
                    administration and transport accounted for 27% and 14.5% of employment respectively, while the next
                    three largest sectors - real-estate, education, and healthcare – employed another ~10% each (FSSS,
                    2018).</p>

                <p>Overall, Salekhard is much more economically diverse than Vorkuta and thus should be better able
                    to
                    mitigate the effects of booms-busts in natural gas prices. However, the city’s economy was
                    altered
                    by the natural gas boom, and the construction sector particularly indisuggests the fragility
                    that
                    plagues even successful Arctic cities. To accommodate the influx of people migrating to
                    Salekhard,
                    massive expansion projects reminiscent of Vorkuta in the 1950s-70s began (<a href="#figure15b">Figure
                        15b</a>). Fancy new
                    apartment blocks went up and a massive urban park, with an artificial river and bridge, were
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>In 2009, encouraged by recovering natural gas prices, Salekhard began to expand aggressively,. ,
                    The
                    number of construction workers increased two-fold in only a few years (FSSS, 2018). When
                    natural
                    gas prices sank again in 2015, many of these construction projects were either frozen or
                    completely
                    abandoned. Downturns in the price for gas immediately impacted progress on ongoing projects,
                    slowing them to a crawl or halting them completely (<a href="#figure15a">Figure 15a</a>).
                    However,
                    Salekhard remains
                    strategically close to resources and poised to boom again as natural gas price rebound amid
                    rising
                    demand from Asia (IEA, 2017).</p>

                <p>Increasing economic diversity is critical to the long-term futures of Vorkuta and Salekhard, as
                    it
                    makes the cities’ less dependent on the fluctuating commodity price of a single resource
                    (Reisser,
                    2016). The larger the proportion of city residents directly involved in one single industry,
                    the
                    more severe the drop in commodity prices, the more severe the effects on the economy and
                    support of
                    the physical infrastructure of the city.</p>
                <p>Many researchers have argued that development plans dominated by the interests of a single
                    industry
                    can inhibit the ability of a city to grow naturally through local innovation and production
                    (Zamyatina & Pilyasov, 2016). Vorkuta has already proven that intensive expansion, fueled by a
                    resource boom, can have long-term negative outcomes when infrastructure cannot be maintained
                    (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>). Planning for the future should carefully consider these
                    lessons from the past. </p>

                <p>There is a common ideology within Russia that people who live in the Arctic should be able to
                    have
                    access to the same comforts as elsewhere. This applies to social services, such as education
                    and
                    healthcare, and housing. The view is that if the appropriate quality-of-life is achieved, then
                    the
                    city and society will be able to thrive and function. As Vorkuta transitioned from a prison
                    camp to
                    a company town, it was challenged to improve the quality-of-life and housing options for the
                    incoming workers and administrators. When these workers departed due to economic declines, the
                    city
                    was left to maintain and service the remaining physical structures. This put a huge strain on
                    many
                    social services, from public transport to the centralized hot water system, as these far-flung
                    services were funded and maintained by a quickly shrinking tax-base. Due to expansion for a
                    temporary resource boom the city was saddled with a public infrastructure it could not hope to
                    maintain during a bust, something that will continue to impact the social well-being of Vorkuta
                    into the future.</p>
                <p>Vorkuta today cannot afford to build any new housing or infrastructure and is instead focused on
                    renovating and maintaining what it can. The city only commissioned 1164.8 square meters of new
                    housing in 2016, not even recording any data between 2009-2015 (FSSS, 2018). Improvements are
                    achieved through the transfer of families from dilapidated buildings on the outskirts (<a href="#figure17">Figure
                        17</a>)
                    to better maintained buildings in the urban core allowing the city to concentrate its services.
                    The
                    number of people living in dilapidated houses fell from 12,501 in 2008 to 309 in 2016, while
                    the
                    number of families registered as in-need of housing has also dropped from 1,347 in 2008 to 210
                    in
                    2016 (FSSS, 2018). Meanwhile, spending on education has nearly doubled since 2006. These
                    statistics
                    show that Vorkuta is shrinking economically, and the overall reach and quality of its social
                    services are declining as a result. To address this, the city is concentrating on maintaining a
                    basic quality-of-life within a concentrated downtown area for the remaining population.</p>

                    efficient city management. The renovation plans are ambitious, but uncertainty over funding and
                    investments remain a critical issue. Photos by Nikolay Shiklomanov.</div>
                <p>The expectation of comfortable living in the Arctic also affects Salekhard. Since 2006, this
                    city
                    has commissioned an average of 32,850 sq. meters of new housing each year, most of it in the
                    form
                    of modern apartment complexes. However, this city, with a population of 48,756 still had nearly
                    1,709 families registered as in-need of housing in 2016 (FSSS, 2018), over eight times the
                    number
                    in Vorkuta with its population of 81,442. The natural gas boom combined with a small housing
                    stock
                    drove up living costs for many residents. The number of citizens who received social benefits
                    to
                    supplement housing and utility costs rose from 5,347 in 2008 to 10,255 in 2016 (FSSS, 2018),
                    over
                    20% of the population. The city also invested heavily in infrastructure, including new theater,
                    religious facilities, luxury hotels, restaurants, and administrative offices. As Salekhard
                    boomed,
                    it focused on improvements to attract a new population. In the event of a bust this population
                    of
                    skilled workers is the most likely to depart to pursue better prospects elsewhere, as occurred
                    in
                    Vorkuta. This calls into question the efficacy of these developments, as the responsibility for
                    the
                    long-term maintenance of these physical structures will likely be passed on to the city in
                    leaner
                    economic times.</p>
                <p>While boom-bust cycles have a significant impact on the economic and social stability of these
                    cities, climate-change is playing an increasingly significant role. Climate-change is occurring
                    at
                    an accelerated rate in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at twice the global average
                    (Serreze & Barry, 2011). These climatic changes are impacting human systems in Salekhard and
                    Vorkuta. Many buildings in these cities are built on permafrost, which has been warming because
                    of
                    climate-change. As permafrost thaws, it decreases ground-bearing capacity and increases ground
                    subsidence, which impacts built infrastructure. These impacts, which include cracked
                    foundations and walls, are visible in the old buildings in the Arctic today and have been
                    projected
                    to be very costly in many regions (Melvin et al., 2016; Shiklomanov et al., 2017; Streletskiy
                    et
                    al. 2019). The trade-off between the short-term economic benefits of fossil fuel extraction and
                    the
                    future costs of mitigating the effects of climate change are complex and will certainly be a
                    long-term issue for these cities.</p>

                <p>In short, while planning for growth is important, it is equally important to plan for decline as
                    this will to minimize wasteful development and maximize the local benefits of growth.
                    Sustainability in an Arctic city will look very different from sustainability in most global cities
                    (Orttung et al., 2016). Many might argue that there is no such thing as a sustainable Arctic city,
                    because the region’s development is so closely linked to development fueled by the extractive
                    industry. But Vorkuta has shown that some residents will always remain, even if the resources
                    diminish or disappear. These cities will continue to exist in some form for many years, and thus it
                    is important to further research alternative development paths they could take (Zamyatina &
                    Pilyasov, 2016). </p>
                <p>Vorkuta planned for growth until the point of its downturn in the late 1980s and early 1990s
                    (Barenberg, 2014). Though this collapse was exacerbated by outside factors it almost certainly
                    would have happened organically because of the eventual fluctuations in resource commodity prices.
                    Vorkuta was shocked by the intensity of its decline in these initial years and was particularly
                    impacted because city leaders had no plans for such a scenario. This resulted in chaotic decline,
                    residents sometimes forcefully relocated, the mass-flight of skilled workers, and the crumbling of
                    entire neighborhoods. Now that a plan for managed decline has been instituted on a city level, the
                    bust of Vorkuta has turned from a hemorrhagic wound to a slow bleed. While the city is still in
                    decline, it now has a plan to flatten out population decline, maintain the urban core, and restore
                    public services to better serve the remaining population (Vorkuta City Planning Office, 2017). This
                    supports the idea that a planned decline, focused on non-economic outcomes (Hollander et al.,
                    2016), might be the best option for these Arctic cities. Though many experts initially predicted
                    that Vorkuta would entirely disappear (Barenberg, 2014), the institution of a planned decline has
                    resulted in a less catastrophic outlook. While the chances of a full recovery are slim, Vorkuta
                    will be present in some form for many years to come, and because of its contraction and adaptation
                    could become a sustainable city based on a small coal-sector and a locally-oriented economy. These
                    cities rely on the production of fossil fuels and wouldn’t exist in their current form without
                    these resources. Neither is likely to halt their contribution to emissions, nor would their efforts
                    make a hugely notable difference to global emission totals.</p>
                <p>The prospects for Salekhard are different, both because of its historical context, but also because
                    of its stage of development in the boom-bust cycle. Salekhard has a more diverse economy, which
                    grew organically out of its historic role as a trading post, transport hub, and administrative
                    center. In the event of a catastrophic bust, this diversity should allay some of the economic and
                    social impacts of a bust. Nonetheless the primary driver for Salekhard’s large-scale development
                    has been an intensive resource boom, and a 2008 bust hurt the city, which awaits price recovery.
                    The evidence of this freeze is evident all around the city, from construction sites, to development
                    billboards touting 2015 completion dates, to luxury hotels serving a single guest. The next upsurge
                    in gas prices is sure to come, and this has many residents optimistic for the future, envisioning a
                    Salekhard with all its development projects completed. This optimism is also echoed in Moscow,
                    which has approved large-scale multi-billion-dollar projects including a bridge over the Ob and a
                    renovated railway between Salekhard and Nadym (Railway Gazette, 2016; Staalesen, 2016). These
                    promises, though ambitious, are likely hollow, reminiscent of the failed Transpolar Mainline.
                    Administrators in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug also plan to expand mining operations in the
                    Ural Mountains to promote further development. Salekhard has no plans for a “shrinking city”
                    (Hollander et al., 2016), which could result in it facing a similar situation to what Vorkuta faced
                    decades earlier. The city, though temporarily frozen, is seemingly still “locked-in” the
                    traditional development path, stifling local innovation and sustainable growth (Zamyatina &
                    Pilyasov 2016). However, this stasis should be viewed as unique opportunity to carefully consider
                    the city’s future and long-term urban planning.</p>
                <h3>FURTHER READING</h3>
                <p>The author highly recommends further reading on the subject of Arctic Urban Sustainability (Orttung
                    et al., 2016, Shiklomanov et al., 2017, Suter et al., 2017) as well as the wider context of
                    post-socialism in Russia (Hamilton, 2017), which has been a dynamic field since the 1990s.
                    Furthermore, this article, while dealing with a very specific and unique region, is inexorably
                    linked to the wider global discussion of human-environment interactions (Middleton, 1995). Any
                    interested reader is highly encouraged to utilize the resources referenced in this paper (and
                    beyond) to further develop their understanding of the complex relationships and historical linkages
                    at play.</p>
