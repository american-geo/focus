                    This is the response I (Hsiao) received from Mr. Wong, a Chinese business owner along William Street
                    in Kampala, Uganda, when I asked for his opinion on life in Uganda. His response was surprising,
                    because it was much more positive than I had been expecting, given the general tone of articles I
                    read leading up to my research trip to Kampala in the summer of 2018.

            <p>China’s political and economic engagement with African states is a hot topic. But it is often simplified
                in popular debate. China’s role on the continent tends to be positioned as neo-colonial and
                exploitative, exemplified most recently in a 2019 Forbes article that claims China “wants everything”
                from Africa, serving China’s “ambitions to write the rules of the next stage of globalization”
                (Mourdoukoutas 2019). On the other hand, pro- Chinese media portray the relationship as far more
                democratic, mutually beneficial, and “anything but a debt-trap” (“Why Belt and Road” 2019). What made
                Mr. Wong’s response so unexpected was how mundane his outlook was. It did not fit into either familiar
                narrative on China-Africa; he did not seem like he was there in Kampala to try to exploit locals, but
                neither did he seem overly enthusiastic about helping them, in the vein of “win-win” cooperation. He
                just seemed like a person trying to make a living. </p>
            <p>The intellectual and policy-oriented narratives that dominate China-Africa debate remain focused on
                macro-level interactions between governments, corporations, and banks, and quantitative data such as the
                cost of infrastructure projects and the size of certain loans. While important, this scalar emphasis
                misses an important part of the story. As Mr. Wong’s words above suggest, something far more complex and
                embodied is really at work. China’s engagement with Africa and vice versa involves people like Mr. Wong,
                each with their own motivations, concerns, and goals that are separate from grand narratives of mutual
                development or exploitation. These people are motivated by more mundane concerns, such as how to make a
                living for their family. A small but growing body of research reflects a recognition of the need for
                more fine-grained and qualitative analyses (Driessen 2016; Postel 2017; Huynh 2018; Warmerdam and van
                Dijk 2016). </p>
        </section>
        <section id="introduction-b" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp1b" title="Introduction (2)">
            <p>This project builds on this kind of work, utilizing a feminist geographic framework to understand
                China-Africa relations. This means that we recognize that those every-day, intimate and or micro-level
                interactions, are also vital to pay attention to and cannot be separated from the macro geoeconomic and
                geopolitical. As such, while traditional political economic analyses tend to examine China-Africa from a
                purely economic standpoint, a feminist geographic approach accepts that economic and social processes
                are interconnected and mutually influential. Much can be revealed to us if we examine the geopolitical
                relations between China and countries in Africa via a “global intimate” lens (Pratt and Rosner 2006),
                one that includes the experiences of Mr. Wong. Several others before us have already begun these
                efforts, focusing on small Chinese trading communities in places like South Africa (Huynh, 2018; Deumert
                and Mabandla, 2013). That this body of work connects with wider feminist moves in economic geography to
                highlight the importance of researching and valuing subjects, spaces and scales that are usually
                ignored. In this paper, we do so with a focus on small scale traders in Uganda from China. Here in East
                Africa, a multitude of new infrastructure projects are underway. Uganda is a significant nation in the
                China-Africa discussion because it was one of the first nations to declare that it intended to model its
                own development after that of China (Shen and Taylor 2012). The Chinese community there is also
                relatively less researched, addressed in only a handful of publications (Warmerdam and van Dijk 2016;
                Arsene 2019).</p>
            <p>Popular western media outlets like <i>The New York Times</i> have reported on several hydroelectric
                projects in Uganda, including the Isimba and Karuma dam projects. In these, China’s involvement is
                typically framed as “competition” for American firms, where large international actors “scramble” for
                the “prize” of infrastructure contracts (Wong 2019). This echoes earlier colonial efforts laid out in
                the Berlin Conference of 1884 to divide up the resources of the continent for European powers. Yet
                Ugandan media sources often differ in their narrative. For example, journalists in the Ugandan media
                outlet <i>The Independent</i> argue that China is a better alternative to institutions such as the World

            <p>By examining the everyday social and economic interactions of Chinese traders and entrepreneurs in
                Kampala, and what spaces they occupy around the city, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the
                global-intimacies of China-Africa engagement. To do so here, we ask: What is the scope and form of
                Chinese investment in Uganda? What are some of the main ways that the Chinese state, government and
                individuals are engaging in the Ugandan economy, and how does this contribute to Chinese soft power? And
                on a more intimate scale: what are the motivations, concerns and everyday experiences of Chinese
                individuals on the ground in Kampala?</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>To answer these questions, Author 1 (Hsiao) undertook three main methods of data gathering. First,
                secondary work on online trade databases and articles was conducted for economic figures and statistics,
                particularly to examine specific economic sectors where China is active in Uganda, with additional data
                drawn from Author 2’s (Faria) dataset of research on economic activity in Kampala. Secondly, I (Hsiao)
                gathered ethnographic observations, including retail geography mapping techniques and participant
                observation in public spaces and events over two periods of field research in Kampala. Lastly, I
                conducted interviews of traders along William Street in Kampala, Uganda. This research occurred in
                January 2019. The data was analyzed collaboratively by Authors 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>Informed by feminist and critical methodologies, our work relies mainly on qualitative data gathered
                through fieldwork, particularly approaches such as in-depth interviews, participant observation and
                ethnographic methods. However, what is important in our critical framework is not just how data about a
                phenomenon is being gathered, analyzed and used; the positionality of the researchers themselves must
                also be addressed. The ‘position’ of a researcher is made up of many factors, such as their personality,
                history, identity, and other characteristics. Not only does their position affect their insights into
                and interpretation of data, but actually affects how the researched subjects respond to the researcher’s
                presence. In order to address the potential for power imbalances between the researcher and the
                researched, feminist methodologies advocate for collaboration, where fieldwork is an interactive
                experience (England, 1994). Being aware of how the position of the researcher affects the discourses
                present in their work is necessary if we are to move beyond single stories of China-Africa.</p>
            <p>In the particular context of interviewing and interacting with Chinese in Africa, the positionality of
                the researcher is particularly important because of the performative nature of speech (Schmitz, 2018);
                responses from Chinese will vary given who their audience is, and what they are trying to accomplish
                with their speech and why. The position of Author 1 as a researcher of mixed ethnic background but
                fluent in Mandarin contributed to the kinds of data able to be gathered as part of this study, as many
                subjects expressed interest in her and why she could speak their language, which opened the window to
                conversation and approaching people for interviews and information. To establish trust and mutual
                connections, Author 1 would inform the merchants during casual conversation that her paternal
                grandfather was from Shandong province. The highly informal nature of the conversations meant that it
                was difficult to get traders to stick to the planned interview questions, as many wanted to turn the
                conversation back to Author 1’s family background. Author 1’s position as ethnically ambiguous and
                linguistically flexible also allowed her to collect ethnographic data in Chinese-dominated spaces such
                as the 2018 Dragonboat Festival celebrations by Lake Victoria in Entebbe, or a Chinese soccer tournament
                by Lugogo Mall, as well as during her normal everyday excursions throughout the city. Coming across
                Chinese during casual activities carried out without intending to specifically seek out Chinese, such as
                eating at a popular brunch spot or visiting a craft market for some trinket shopping, provided valuable
                information on how Chinese navigate the city. Elaine Ho describes a similar method of data gathering,
                where her position as a Singaporean with connections to China allowed her to conduct ethnographic work
                on Chinese migration during her everyday life (Ho, 2019).</p>

            <h3>Political and Economic ties between China and Uganda</h3>
            <p>China is involved in a wide range of economic and political activities in Uganda. Primarily these
                include; infrastructural development, educational training, trade relations and manufacturing. Following
                the first bilateral treaty between China and Uganda, signed in 2004, there have been a number of other
                agreements between the two nations (“China- Uganda BIT” 2004). In 2006, Uganda and China signed a series
                of agreements focusing on economy, trade, agriculture, education, and technology, and in June 2019 the
                two nations agreed to establish their relationship as a “comprehensive cooperative partnership” (“China,
                Uganda Sign” 2006; “China-Uganda Lift Ties” 2019). In addition to cooperation between the two on a
                national government level, the Ugandan government has also begun establishing relationships with
                individual Chinese provinces. For example, in June 2018, Uganda signed a deal with the government of
                China’s Hunan Province, focusing on collaboration in the “key sectors” of agriculture, mining, energy
                (hydro power, solar, and wind energy), tourism, and industrialization (“China’s Hunan Province”
                2018).</p>

            <p>One of the most visible areas of Chinese economic activity in Uganda is the realm of infrastructure
                construction. The importance of infrastructure is also reflected in the focus areas of the previously
                mentioned agreements between Uganda and China, which place emphasis on collaboration in the realms of
                energy, agriculture, mining, and technology. Uganda hopes to secure loans from China for the Ugandan
                section of the Standard Gauge Railway. This is a regional project that will construct a railway line
                across East Africa from Kenya into multiple cities in Uganda, Rwanda, and even South Sudan, which will
                dramatically increase access to coastal ports like Mombasa in Kenya (Anyanzwa 2019). Currently, only the
                Mombasa-Nairobi line is operational, although it is operating in the negative; until the viability and
                sustainability of the project can be evaluated, China has not yet approved the loans needed for the
                Ugandan extension of the line (Herbling and Li 2019). Other major planned and completed projects include
                the expansion of Entebbe International Airport and the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway, which opened in June
                2018 (Ladu 2015). One of the major players in Ugandan infrastructure projects is China Communications
                Construction Company (CCCC), who worked on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway. During travel in Uganda, we
                found the CCCC operating across the country, including in the Murchison Falls National Park in
                North-western Uganda (Figure 2).</p>

            </div>
            <p>Another major area of China-Ugandan engagement is through education. Opening its doors in 2014, the
                Confucius Institute at Makerere University is a Chinese government- backed program. It focuses on
                cultural exchange and language instruction, offering Chinese language courses to Makerere students and
                the wider Kampala community (“Services” 2019). Furthermore, a teacher-training program is underway at a
                private school in Kampala, Luyanzi College Bweyogerere (see Figure 3). This is owned by a Chinese woman,
                Wang Li Hong Sooma, and her Ugandan husband Ayub Sooma. This program is training Ugandan teachers in
                Chinese language instruction. It is funded by the Chinese government and supported by resources from the
                Confucius Institute at Makerere (Byaruhanga 2019). The goal of the program is to increase the presence
                of Chinese language courses available in Uganda, in order to ultimately aid Ugandan students with
                accessing international education and business opportunities. As of December 2018, 35 secondary schools
                will offer Chinese language courses, and Makerere University in Kampala has announced plans to offer a
                bachelor's program in Chinese language and culture by the year 2019/2020 (Wandera 2018).</p>

            <p>Last, and of particular interest to our project, are China-Uganda trading ties, which are centered in the
                2006 agreements signed between the two nations. In 2017, Uganda imported $1.15 billion worth of products
                from China. Of these imports, 47% are machines such as broadcasting equipment, phones, and semiconductor
                devices; 9.2% are textiles such as used clothing; 8.4% are chemical products such as pesticides; 7.3%
                are plastics and rubbers; and 4.9% are footwear and headwear (“What Does China Export” 2017). In turn,
                only 5.9% of Uganda’s total exports go to China, worth $44.6 million. Products imported from Uganda by
                China include tanned equine and bovine hides (48% of imports from Uganda), other oily seeds (17%),
                coffee (6.1%), and scrap plastic (5.2%) (“What Does China Import” 2017). Recently, Chinese companies
                have ramped up manufacturing in the country. In 2016, the China-Uganda Agricultural Industrial Park
                opened. This is one of several China-backed industrial parks in Uganda. Another is Tian Tang Industrial
                Park, which has four factories that work with steel, foam, and wood (Huaxia 2019).</p>
            <p>Given the increasing partnerships between China and Uganda, Chinese companies, politicians and
                individuals
                have significant and growing influence in the country. However, most of the media coverage and exposure
                we
                receive is concerned with specific groups of highly visible Chinese: diplomats, officials, employees of
                large corporations, and those in the construction business. What about Chinese traders in the city,
                those
                that interact with ordinary Ugandans more intimately on a daily basis? Drawing on the work by Nagar et
                al.
                on economic geography, we want to refocus on the voices that are most often excluded in economic
                analysis,
                such as migrants and those engaged in informal sectors of the economy. Below, we focus on this group of
                Chinese migrants in Uganda. We ask: where are they located in the city? Who are they, where are they
                from,
                and what are their drivers for moving to Uganda? And, lastly, what are their everyday experiences of
                life
                like in Uganda?</p>

            <h3>Locating the Chinese in Kampala: Traders on William Street </h3>
            <p>The location of Chinese businesses around the city of Kampala can reveal to us a lot about their lives.
                Are they all concentrated in one space, like a ‘Chinatown’? How can their proximity, or lack of it, to
                other Chinese businesses impact their relationships with other Chinese, as well as local Ugandans? How
                accessible are their businesses to local customers?</p>
            <p>To answer these questions, Author 1 began by using business permit records to map out Chinese businesses
                in the city. All businesses operating within Kampala city limits are required to register for business
                permits with the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), so we requested registration records from them.
                The KCCA does not record the nationality of business owners, so we devised a way to locate at least
                partial records of registered Chinese-affiliated businesses. Author 1 requested records from the KCCA on
                businesses registered by individuals with the top ten most common Chinese surnames: Chen (陈), Huang (黄),
                Lee/Li (李), Liu (刘), Wang (王), Wu (吴), Yang (杨), Zhang (张), Zhao (赵), Zhou (周) (“百 家姓” 2019).
                Romanization differences resulted in the final list actually consisting of 11 names; “Li” and “Lee” were
                both included but correspond to the same Chinese surname 李. This initial dataset consisted of 658
                results, and included information on the nature of the businesses and their location within Kampala. As
                these locations were denoted by Kampala city zoning designations, some of them were too vague to
                pinpoint on the map, such as “A” or “K10”. However, some locations could be identified with general
                locations on a map, such as “Sixth Street” or “Kampala Road.” Approximate coordinates for these
                identifiable locations were collected from Google maps, with a final total of 398 businesses able to be
                plotted on a map. Figure 4 below is not a trader-specific map, and is by no means a comprehensive
                representation of Chinese businesses throughout the city. But it does tell us some interesting things.
                There is a concentration of traders on William Street, popularly associated with Chinese economic
                activity amongst Kampala-residents.</p>

            <p>Our first map (Figure 4) shows that according to business permit records, there does not appear to be a
                single area within the city with a concentrated presence of Chinese businesses. However, in practice,
                tips from locals pointed towards William Street in Kampala as a place where Chinese could easily be
                found. Located in Nakasero, an area of the city traditionally occupied with trade, William Street is
                mostly populated by Chinese small-scale traders. A small minority of these stores are retail businesses,
                but most of them operate as wholesale operations, hence the abundance of large delivery trucks up and
                down the street, as seen in Figure 5.</p>

            <p>Attempting to carry out GPS-based retail geography mapping using an iPhone, Author 1 walked up and down
                William Street, dropping a pin on a map to mark the location of every storefront she passed that was
                obviously identifiable as Chinese-owned, whether by signage or the presence of Chinese behind the store
                counters. A total of 51 shops were recorded along William Street, with 2 other shops along adjacent
                streets.</p>
