                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Between 1877 and 1950, White lynch mobs murdered at least 4,400 African Americans. Often carried out
                    with impunity, these killings were a tactic for controlling Black populations through
                    community-level terror (Equal Justice Initiative 2017). The scope and scale of this killing is
                    overwhelming and calls out for conceptualizing it in place. Until recently, few public memorial
                    projects had attempted to narrate the histories of violence, dispossession, and oppression
                    associated with lynching. Now, demand for memorializing the victims of historical lynching grows as
                    activists—in the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breona Taylor, and so many
                    others—insist on greater social reckoning with the continuing precarity of Black lives. </p>
                <p> The southeastern United States as a region has many locations marked by the lynching of Black men,
                    women, and children and the subsequent violence of actively forgetting and denying these atrocities.
                    Drawing from the path-breaking work of Karen Till (2012), we identify these sites of trauma and
                    amnesia as “wounded places.” As Till notes, activists, artists, non-profits, local and regional
                    governments as well as citizens are increasingly trying to come to terms with these realities
                    through "memory-work." Memory-work draws attention to the range of labor—intellectual, social,
                    bodily and political—required to create new public memorials that build the social capacity to
                    recognize, understand, and act upon the legacies of discrimination and violence. These places of
                    memory open up opportunities not only for marginalized people to assert their rights but also for
                    the wider society to confront and take responsibility for perpetuating injustice.</p>
                <p>Montgomery, Alabama highlights this memory-work process, showing how it affects the design and
                    meaning of places and the legacy of race and racism in cities in the Southeastern USA. Although
                    Montgomery has received limited attention from geographers in the past, the city is home to one of
                    the most recent and ambitious memory-work projects in the nation, the Equal Justice Initiative
                    (EJI). In addition to providing legal representation to those denied a fair trial and advocating for
                    criminal justice reform, EJI and its founder and Executive Director Bryan Stevenson have led the
                    construction of The Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice. Both sites
                    narrate in unflinching graphic terms the history of racism against Black people beginning with
                    enslavement. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice has garnered particular attention for
                    speaking to the ways in which lynching is an unreconciled chapter in the nation’s story of race
                    relations and a bond between past and present racial inequalities. </p>
                <p>This photo essay offers a visual and narrative exploration of the memory-work in the National
                    Memorial, the affective power of its mission and message, its broader situation within Montgomery,
                    and the lessons it might hold for enhancing the political efficacy and social healing associated
                    with commemorative change and reform in a racialized America and in the Southeast. In doing so, we
                    hope to show the value of conducting critical spatial readings of memorial landscapes and the
                    important but complex role that place plays in publicly narrating histories in an anti-racist ways
                </p>

                <div class="caption">Caption 1: Over the last decade, the City of Montgomery has invested in its
                    downtown core. Interspersed, sometimes uncomfortably but necessarily, among the new restaurants, a
                    baseball stadium, boutiques and high rises are reminders of the city’s past and its connection to
                    the most divisive moments in U.S. history. To find Maya Angelou’s admonition displayed so
                    prominently on the landscape along with a number of historical markers to Montgomery’s significant
                    involvement in the domestic slave trade is indicative of the visibility of the city’s ongoing
                    memory-work. A geography of remembering is emerging that even the most casual and uninterested
                    person passing by must acknowledge at some level. The Angelou quote adorns the site of former
                    warehouse used to imprison enslaved African Americans and now EJI’s Legacy Museum, which chronicles
                    the continuing legacies of slavery, lynching, racial segregation, and mass incarceration. EJI
                    collaborated with the Black Heritage Council of the Alabama Historical Commission to sponsor the
                    establishment of slavery-related historical markers in downtown Montgomery. In addition, the
                    organization established a “Memory Wall” in the Peace and Justice Garden right outside the entrance
                    of its memorial to lynching victims to recognize the strength and skill of Black Americans held in
                    bondage in Montgomery. The wall is composed of bricks fashioned by enslaved artisans in the 1850s
                    for the city’s theater and offers—along with the aforementioned quote, museum, and markers—a
                    touchstone for recognizing how our most everyday spaces can be racially wounded places in need of
                    being addressed (Alderman et al. 2020).</div>

                    (Tuan 1976; Schwartz and Ryan 2003; Schnell and Reese 2014). We define place identity as the
                    collective understandings of places contributing to a sense of shared belonging (Blake 2008;
                    Antonsich 2010). Visual media are cultural texts, conveying dominant ideologies through reproducing
                    selective visions of place (Pritchard and Morgan 2003). They are also a primary means of
                    constructing social memories, particularly about place, that are crucial to identity formation
                    (Hoelscher and Alderman 2004). From landscape paintings (Allen 1992) and magazine illustrations
                    (Wyckoff and Nash 1994) to beer labels (Schnell and Reese 2014) and comic books (Dittmer 2005),
                    visual media in their myriad forms articulate selective visions of place.</p>
                <p>Postcards (Blake 2008; Youngs 2011; Youngs 2012) also manufacture and project place identity.
                    Postcards are not neutral representations of the places they depict. Instead, they project idealized
                    and selective visions of place, where their images are edited for particular meanings. Youngs
                    (2011), for example, finds that Grand Canyon postcards are edited to convey idealized images of
                    place. Postcards also have the ability to reach a geographically far-flung audience and shape how
                    this audience understands places. Valued as collectors’ items, souvenirs, and a means of
                    correspondence, postcards remain available at many tourist waypoints, including gas-stations,
                    museums, or national park gift stores. Their utility and popularity may also be explained by
                    postcards’ material form and the implications it has for social memory. As Delyser (2004) suggests,
                    social memory is recaptured through examining even the smallest traces of past experiences. Serving
                    as souvenirs, postcards are small, easily stored linkages between places and people. Kept in a
                    scrapbook, magnetized to a refrigerator door, or mailed to friends and family, postcards like the
                    Anderson Design Group collection are a source and shaper of place identity.</p>
                <p>Previous geographical postcard analyses inform our examination of the ADG postcard collection. First,
                    we employ content analysis to identify the postcards’ major themes. We follow Blake (2008) and
                    Youngs (2011) by recognizing that postcards must be examined holistically. The whole postcard is
                    greater than the sum of its parts. Second, we complement existing geographical postcard analysis by
                    using a contemporary case study. Studies within geography predominantly use historical postcards as
                    their source materials (Pritchard and Morgan 2003). Our research showcases the importance of
                    twenty-first century postcard analysis.</p>

                <div class="caption">Caption 2:Long remembered and venerated as the first Capitol of the Confederacy and
                    more recently for George Wallace’s vitriolic support of segregation, Montgomery is now the
                    self-declared “Capital Cool.”
                    Any effort to understand the city’s decision to reconnect to its past and to incorporate diverse and
                    contradictory memories must be carried through a complex lens of interpretation. Such a lens
                    recognizes not only the raw activism of memory-work and the taking of responsibility for histories
                    and victims of racism but also how Montgomery and other southern cities appropriate or co-opt
                    commemorative change in serving the growing market influence of civil rights tourism and neoliberal
                    urban development and promotion. Many municipal leaders advocate for commemorative change simply to
                    defuse public controversy and thus avoid difficult discussions about the still strong presence of
                    White supremacy in communities. In 2015, in the wake of the Charleston Massacre, Alabama Governor
                    Robert Bentley took down the Confederate battle flag and other Civil War-related flags from the foot
                    of the Confederate memorial on the State Capitol grounds in Montgomery, leaving behind conspicuously
                    empty flagpole mounts. The nation, in this case the New York Times, is taking notice of Montgomery’s
                    memory-work of confronting the historical legacies of racism, and for some in the city that is one
                    of the major motivations to engage memories traditionally repressed and suppressed.

                <h3>Examining the Postcards</h3>
                <p>Anderson Design Group’s centennial postcard collection provides the source materials for our content
                    analysis. We initially reviewed the entire collection to develop a general understanding of the
                    collection’s content. Following Youngs’ (2012) methods, we categorized and quantified images
                    important to identifying postcard themes such as the appearance of wildlife, presence of people,
                    depictions of historic sites, and scenic views. In doing so, however, we confronted the lesson
                    cultural geographers are careful to remember in exploring representations of place through content
                    analysis: conflating features for meaning (Schnell 2011). We felt our initial quantitative approach
                    failed to capture the greater themes embedded in the collection. Our subsequent examination
                    recognized the importance of subjectivity in analysis. We embraced the complexities of postcards by
                    considering each as an individual work of art, understood and interpreted holistically for the
                    collection’s major themes.</p>
                <p>Four significant themes emerged from our revised qualitative content analysis that understands
                    postcards as shapers of national park place identity. Anderson Design Group’s centennial postcard
                    collection presents the national parks as 1) nature’s refuge; 2) America’s playground; 3) American
                    heritage; and 4) mythic space. In the following sections, we examine how selected postcards
                    exemplify a particular theme of the national parks. To do so, we identify how features in ADG’s
                    collection help construct a particular theme. Second, we interpret these features to understand how
                    they contribute to national park place identity.</p>

                <div class="caption">Caption 3: The birthplace of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and one of the first major
                    civil rights victories on the long road toward freedom in the 1950s and 1960s, Dexter Avenue Baptist
                    Church sits in the shadow of the Alabama State Capitol Building, which doubled as the Capitol of the
                    Confederacy. Dexter reminds us that US history has always included the lives and perspectives of
                    African Americans, even if it takes decades to begin to come to terms with that story is and how we
                    remember it. Nearby is a marker that recalls the Voting Rights March, which began with the bloody
                    encounters at Selma’s Edmund Pettis Bridge and ended at the State Capitol Building in Montgomery.
                    The march precipitated the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act—arguably the crowning achievement
                    of the Southern Movement for civil and political rights. Directly across the street from the voting
                    rights marker is a heavily stained and nearly unreadable marker to the Confederacy, suggesting how
                    different and even conflicting memories can claim and appear to occupy in an unproblematic way the
                    same space. Important to the project of memory-work, according to architectural historian Dell Upton
                    (2015), is challenging the tendency in Montgomery and other cities to separate Black and White
                    history into a dual heritage of “parallel, equally honorable paths" rather than seeing them as
                    consequentially entangled. The EJI’s memorial to lynching is significant in acknowledging how a
                    study of civil rights struggle is impossible without an open accounting of the history of White
                    violence and discrimination against communities of color.</div>

            <section id="3a" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp3a" title="Nature's Refuge">
                <h3>Nature's Refuge</h3>
                <p>The vision of the national parks as nature’s refuge is the most prominent theme of the postcard
                    collection. Postcards most representative of this theme depict charismatic wildlife; images of
                    pristine wilderness; powerful geologic and fluvial processes; and an absence of humans and human
                    activity. This theme primarily taps into deeply rooted wilderness attitudes towards nature and
                    affirms popularly entrenched assumptions that humans and nature are separate and oppositional
                    entities (Cronon 1995).</p>
                <p>The Katmai National Park postcard epitomizes the theme of national parks as nature’s refuge. Three
                    mature grizzlies dominate the scene as they hunt for spawning salmon forcing their way upstream.
                    Intent on their task, the bears fix their eyes on the water. The beholding eye of the postcard
                    viewer cannot help but be drawn to the bear in the foreground, depicted here a split second before
                    capturing a leaping fish. The spawning fish and saturated blue of the fast-flowing river suggests a
                    healthy riparian system, as does the rich and thick greenery lining the river’s banks. The interplay
                    of shadow and light on the vegetation and water, the orange sky above, and the warm hues that
                    highlight the bears’ richly textured hides all suggest a crepuscular scene moments before an unseen
                    sun sinks below the horizon (Figure 1)</p>

                <div class="caption">Caption 4: Early on, the Equal Justice Initiative recognized that many of
                    Montgomery’s historical markers, museums, and other commemorative symbols glorified the history of
                    the Confederacy. In addition to being a major change for the City of Montgomery, the National
                    Memorial for Peace and Justice represents a first for a nation that had not sufficiently
                    memorialized the victims of lynching. Officials have never bothered to create a comprehensive
                    accounting of the number, location, and cause of lynching deaths. Preceding the opening of the
                    National Memorial in Montgomery, EJI generated a highly publicized Lynching in America report. The
                    report conducted an exacting historical count of murdered African Americans and, at the same time,
                    sought to make those bodies count or matter within public thought and debate, even as EJI recognized
                    that their census of racialized murders was incomplete. Some suffering is not fully knowable because
                    of the nature of oppression and disregard for life. To recognize this fact is not just about being
                    historically accurate but also about doing justice to the victims of historical violence. Stretching
                    out and across the entryway to the National Memorial is a quote from Martin Luther King Jr., who
                    proclaimed, “True peace is not merely the absence of tension. It is the presence of justice.”
                    Memory-work is as much about creative tension and destabilizing taken for granted narratives about
                    the past as it is about presenting unified, comforting stories.</div>

                <p>Katmai National Park presents an untrammeled and dynamic nature, where fluvial and biological
                    processes intertwine and continue unabated. Through light, color, and shadow, the sky, water, bears,
                    and fish are all imbued with a sense of movement. The water flows with enough force to splash upward
                    and soak the bears’ underbellies. The viewer can almost hear the burbling roar of the water as it
                    flows and crashes over the rocky riverbed. The fishes’ muscular bodies twist in effort as they try
                    to make their way up the fast-flowing rapids. One can imagine their frenetic and desperate movements
                    as they launch themselves into air. The bears’ intense focus and raw power are subtly captured in
                    how they hunch over the water, muscles tense as they wait, poised, to snap their jaws shut on prey.
                </p>
                <p>In this scene from Katmai, there are no humans to interfere with the life-and-death struggle playing
                    out between two charismatic beings in the waning daylight of the Alaskan backcountry. Human absence
                    reveals the national parks as a last bastion of wild nature. Furthermore, Katmai and the other
                    national parks postcards convey a distinctly American nature. The use of the charismatic fauna in
                    national park imagery suggests a form of American national identity bound to natural resources and a
                    wilderness experience (Cronon 1995).</p>

                <h3>America's Playground</h3>
                <p>The second most visible theme of ADG's postcard collection is that of an American playground.
                    National parks become sites where people can enjoy recreating in some of the country’s most
                    spectacular places. Many of these postcards explicitly depict people at play. Sailboats, hikers,
                    water planes, canoers, and kayakers feature prominently. Many postcards also include slogans or
                    invitations to the viewer. These exhort viewers to immerse themselves into a particular park
                    experience. The Badlands National Park postcard instructs viewers to “Enjoy the Good Life.” The
                    Carlsbad Caverns postcard encourages viewers to “Walk the Hall of Giants.” Slogans and invitations
                    like these offer a direct link between the viewer and the parks. These slogans promote a set of
                    activities deemed “proper” in park landscapes. No less significant is what goes unsaid by these
                    slogans. Historically significant use of park landscapes, including subsistence lifeways, are left
                    out of the slogans’ narrative. What emerges is a moral geography, where postwar middle-class
                    recreation is privileged (Spence 1996; Jacoby 2001).</p>

                    Alabama Parole Reporting Center and dominating one side of the memorial’s horizon is the large
                    office complex of the US Attorney for Middle District of Alabama. It is a thought provoking spatial
                    association given EJI’s mission of penal justice. Alabama has one of the highest incarceration rates
                    in the world with 946 people per 100,000 in prison (Wagner and Sawyer 2018). The US rate is 698 per
                    100,000 as a way of comparison. Fifty-four percent of the prison population is African American and
                    the disproportionate incarceration rate is a reminder of the brutal geographies that exist across
                    time and space as it relates to racial ‘justice’ in the United States (Gilmore 2007). Undergirding
                    Bryan Stevenson’s memory-work, especially as it relates to lynching, is the belief that challenging
                    contemporary racial inequalities in mass incarceration requires a historical understanding of legal
                    and extra-legal violence against Black people (Hasian and Paliewicz 2020). Meaningful memory-work
                    emphasizes creating new forms of public memory not simply for the sake of history but for addressing
                    the ongoing legacies of trauma and inequality. Within the National Memorial, EJI decidedly moves
                    away from celebratory treatments of civil rights history to argue that the political harassment and
                    brutality now terrorizing poor people of color is a continuation of a long history and geography of
                    anti-Black violence and discrimination. “Hands up don’t shoot” has become a rallying cry for
                    thousands in the wake of the shooting and killing of figures such as Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin,
                    and many others. The struggle to make Black Lives Matter not only connects past and present
                    injustices, but the efforts of African American men and women to assert their individual and
                    collective humanity in a system of justice that was built through enslaved labor, lynching, share
                    cropping and later the prison industrial complex. The National Memorial concludes with this work by
                    Hank Willis Thomas on the precarity of Black life at the hands of law enforcement, but it is a
                    useful starting point here for putting EJI’s memory-work in context.</div>

                <p> Biscayne National Park is the most playful of the entire collection (Figure 2). It best represents
                    the national parks as an American playground. Biscayne is one of the few postcards to depict a
                    waterscape. The point of view is literally immersed in the water, revealing a subtropical reef,
                    brightly colored and patterned fish, and a sea turtle. In the background swims a feminine silhouette
                    equipped in scuba gear. This view is from an impossible vantage point, for the image’s perspective
                    simultaneously captures sights of the water’s surface, the sky above, seabirds, and a small personal
                    sailboat. Across the bottom of the image the postcard proclaims that Biscayne National Park is in
                    the Florida Keys.</p>
                <p> The postcard imbues a sense of playfulness into the scene through the use of subject matter, color,
                    and intertextual associations with place. The diver’s presence suggests that Biscayne is best
                    enjoyed through a literal immersion into place. The postcard’s perspective captures a vision of
                    Biscayne that invites the viewer to join the diver in a subtropical playground. The exotic fish and
                    turtle give reasons as to why the diver has chosen Biscayne. The fishes’ bright colors and scattered
                    arrangement across the image’s foreground draws the eye like thrown confetti. The association
                    between the Florida Keys and Biscayne, meanwhile, introduces an intertextual element to what it
                    means to be in Biscayne National Park. Through invoking the Florida Keys toponym, Biscayne becomes
                    linked with a popular vacation destination. To experience Biscayne is also to engage with the
                    Florida Keys and partake of its recreational amenities for adventurous tourists and snowbirds. Such
                    intertextual references reveal how national parks’ recreational landscapes can transcend park

                <h3>American Heritage</h3>
                <p>A third significant theme is that of a distinct American heritage. Discussions about precise
                    definitions of heritage are numerous and oft-contested. Two definitions frame our identification of
                    heritage as a distinct theme within the postcard series. Graham (2002) suggests heritage is defined
                    best as contemporary use of the past, while Johnson (1999) calls heritage an ideological framing of
                    identity. These two definitions inform our identification of heritage in the centennial postcards
                    through emphasizing their ability to depict American cultural landscapes and ideologies of
                    exceptionalism. The Acadia National Park and Sequoia National Park postcards depict historically
                    significant objects and sites and serve as strong examples of American heritage.</p>

                    long walking path that visitors take to the lynching memorial uses explanatory signage and statues
                    of chained Africans writhing in pain and resistance to create its own narrative. It was as if artist
                    Kwame Akoto-Bamfo captured the moment of initial capture in Africa or arrival in the Americas. One
                    sculpted female slave, with child in arms, reaches out desperately for a stolen or deceased mate.
                    The empty chains at her feet symbolize that absence. The starkness of the memorial and these bodies
                    against the green fields challenges the tradition of trivializing the physical and emotional pain of
                    racism. The images reflect what historian Manning Marable (2002) described as the “deep wells of
                    democracy” on which the nation was built, the reality of terror lynching juxtaposes American
                    democracy with the long and brutal history of racial violence in the nation. </div>

            <section id="5b" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp5b" title="American Heritage (2)">
                <p>The postcard of Acadia National Park showcases an understanding of heritage that aligns with Graham’s
                    (2002) argument that heritage is contemporary use of the past (Figure 3). At the postcard’s top, a
                    slogan instructs viewers to “Visit Beautiful Acadia National Park, Maine.” The eye, however, is
                    first drawn to a tall-masted schooner with a crowded deck. It cuts through calm green waters,
                    angling for an advantageous position to view a whale’s tail breaking the surface. On a rocky cliff
                    shoreline, Bass Head Harbor Lighthouse is immaculate. Its clean lines are framed by a backdrop of
                    thick and continuous evergreens.</p>
                <p>The Acadia National Park postcard resurrects historically significant Maine industries, but
                    transforms them to reflect what is valuable about Acadia’s contemporary park landscape. Schooners,
                    for example, are anchors of the cultural landscapes of New England pelagic fishing industries and
                    were popular 19th century whaling vessels. In this image, whales remain the schooner’s goal, but the
                    ship’s armament is no longer the whaleman’s harpoon, but rather the 21st century tourist’s camera.
                    Thanks to national park protections, the backdrop of evergreens no longer holds value as a rich
                    source of timber (Cronon 1983). Instead, they become part of a larger Acadian landscape aesthetic,
                    one that can be consumed by those seeking beauty on Maine’s coastline. Acadia’s flora and fauna are
                    thus transformed from industrial resource to aesthetic resource.</p>

                <p>Postcards representative of American heritage space are also laden with a sense of American
                    exceptionalism, which aligns with Johnson’s (1999) definition of heritage as an ideological framing
                    of identity. With respect to national parks, American exceptionalism is grounded in superlative
                    landscape features (Runte 2010). Environmental historians and historical geographers have long
                    recognized the role of nature in consolidating a sense of American national identity (Cronon 1995).
                    The postcard image of Sequoia National Park is the strongest example of this phenomenon (Figure 4).

                    dominates the scene and towers high above a miniaturized person and station wagon. The slogan, too,
                    is miniaturized, and the effect is that General Sherman’s image is left to speak for itself. The
                    massive tree and miniaturized slogan work together to proclaim this sequoia as “the world’s
                    biggest,” establishing this national park as the root of an American national identity grounded in
                    monumental nature (Nash 2014; Runte 2010).</p>

                <h3>Mythic Space</h3>
                <p>Highly symbolic, often amorphous, and slipping just out of reach like a willow-o’-the-wisp beckoning
                    a traveler in a dark wood, the nature of myth defies easy comprehension or articulation (White
                    1991). Myths are also intimately bound to place and are embedded in the material world just as much
                    as in the terrain of the mind. Geographical thinking encourages conceptualizations of myth that
                    focus on landscape as much as metaphor. The American Southwest’s Monument Valley, for example, has
                    been cited as a mythic landscape par excellence (Blake 2014). Myths are integral to many cultural
                    landscapes. Mythic space is the final dominant theme present in the centennial postcard collection,
                    and all postcards laden with this theme showcase western landscapes and support the claim that the
                    American West is “arguably the most mythic ever created by a nation from its past” (Murdoch 2001,
                    quoted in Blake 2014 p. 261).</p>
                <p>Those postcards demonstrating mythic space feature heavy use of symbolic figures and iconography. The
                    postcard of Saguaro National Park leverages symbolism and a singular color palette to develop a
                    sense of a mythic landscape (Figure 5).</p>
                <div id="saguaro" class="figure"

                <p>Two symbols of a mythic American West hold primary positions in the image. First, there is the
                    silhouette of a lone rider, an icon wedded to discourses of a masculine frontier central to
                    construction of popular understandings of the West as a region (Blake 1995; Hausladen 2003). Second,
                    there are the park’s eponymous saguaros. Obscured by orange shades of sunset, the saguaros—looming
                    like arid Ents—frame and surround the rider. The backdrop to these western icons also shaped our
                    contemplation of the scene.</p>
                <p>The wider landscape is a desert, affirming widespread understandings of aridity as a defining feature
                    of the American West (Worster 1985; Wright 2014). Rider, saguaros, and desert are arrayed on a
                    deeper tableau. In the scene’s backdrop, hazily outlined mountain silhouettes subtly mirror the
                    sky’s shape above. Contemplating the full image may leave the viewer with a sense that this
                    landscape retains power and agency that defies full human comprehension.</p>

                <div class="caption">aption 7: Upon entering the formal confines of the memorial to lynching victims,
                    one encounters rows and rows of suspended steel monuments, a visual allusion we believe to the way
                    in which lynch mobs hanged many victims from trees. Each suspended form references by name a county
                    where lynchings took place along with the inscribed names of those murdered and the date of the
                    racial terror. Raising consciousness among communities of their culpability in the history of
                    lynching is exactly the intent of EJI, not only the National Memorial for Peace and Justice but also
                    through the Community Remembrance Project. That project collects soil from lynching sites and works
                    with locals to erect historical markers at those sites. A sober realization of the nation’s
                    complicity in the history of racial terror comes over visitors as they stumble upon or seek to find
                    their own home counties among the geographically ordered 800 monuments. Stretching out and across an
                    inner courtyard, the individual names and counties eventually blur until each memorial marker folds
                    into one other.</div>

                <p>Mythic space is also captured in the image of Zion National Park (Figure 6). Visually centered on
                    crepuscular rays streaming through iconic Kolob Arch, this scene draws on long established
                    traditions of romanticism in depicting Western landscapes (Cronon 1995). The bowl of golden sky
                    pours through Kolob Arch. Rays of light illuminate a verdant pine forest. Its rich green stands in
                    stark contrast to the burnt hues of the sandstone cliffs. The waterfall falling over the cliffs on
                    the viewer’s right suggests that springtime has arrived in the Utah desert. Clouds shaped like
                    undiscovered continents are blazoned across an evening sky. Hanging above them is the slogan “See
                    Kolob Arch”. As representative of the national park system, this postcard shapes wider perceptions
                    of not only Kolob Arch and Zion, but also of Western landscapes more generally. Like the image of
                    Saguaro National Park, the Zion postcard’s mythic dimensions are strongest when its image is
                    considered holistically. Its rich color palette and framing of light through an arch helps tap into
                    deeply held Judeo-Christian notions of the divine.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Anderson Design Group’s centennial postcards present narratives aligning with mainstream
                    understandings of the national parks’ historical significance. Our analysis reveals four
                    themes—nature’s refuge, America’s playground, American heritage, and mythic space—that collectively
                    anchor national park place identity. These themes are manifested through ADG’s use of charismatic
                    North American wildlife and images of wilderness; depictions of outdoor recreation and use of
                    inviting slogans; representations of American cultural landscapes; and adept use of iconic images
                    and application of light and color. Widely available to the public, the postcard images actively
                    shape popular understandings of the national parks. The visions present in the postcards reach
                    audiences across the world, offering a powerful reminder of the role visual imagery has in
                    contributing to geographic imaginations.</p>
                <p>The way these postcards frame place identity, however, offers only a partial picture of the federal
                    government’s larger twenty-first century vision for the national parks. While the postcards achieve
                    the task of celebrating and promoting the national parks, their success does not completely align
                    with other park initiatives addressing the rapidly changing terrain of twenty-first century
                    environmental, political, and social challenges facing the national parks. The federal government’s
                    centennial program, including the NPS’s signature event An Evening at the Arch; Secretary of the
                    Interior Dirk Kempthorne’s The Future of America’s National Parks report to President Bush; and
                    President Obama’s Father’s Day address established new directions for the parks. These include
                    revamping outdated and overused park infrastructure, increasing diversity and inclusion, and
                    addressing the consequences of climate change. Although these two narratives remain disconnected in
                    key ways, we believe the tensions between Anderson Design Group’s postcard collection and the
                    federal government’s centennial initiatives do not represent a lasting failure, but instead reveal
                    opportunities for future reconciliation between promotion and policy.</p>

                <div class="caption">Caption 8: The very form, design, layout, and location of memorials have an
                    affective power that advocates hope to harness, to re-work how people interact with, appreciate
                    these painful histories, and imagine the possibility of more socially just futures. This speaks to
                    not only the labor of memory-work, but also the labor involved in taking in and reflecting on the
                    realities of terror lynching in the United States. Initially, as one enters the memorial, the
                    hanging corten steel monuments are at eye level with visitors. As one moves deeper and lower into
                    the memorial, one experiences the suspended monuments from high above, contributing to an
                    overwhelming if not smothering sense of the scope of the injustice. Recognizing the emotional
                    gravity of moving through the memorial, EJI established the Ida B. Wells Memorial Grove, consisting
                    of forty black granite cylinders where visitors can sit and reflect. The functional sculpture,
                    designed by Dana King, honors in Wells one of the first major figures in anti-lynching activism of
                    the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Alderman et al. 2021). Guided by Justice is another one of
                    King’s works found at the National Memorial. It commemorates the often under-acknowledged women who
                    led and sustained the 1950s’s Montgomery bus boycott. EJI reaffirms what scholars such as Katherine
                    McKittrick (2011) argue, namely the importance of not erasing Black humanity, resistance, and sense
                    of place from our discussions of the heavy weight of oppression and racialized violence.</div>
