            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Areas rich in minerals are important for what they provide to the world, but they come with critical settlement challenges. Workers come and go, responding to changes in supply and demand, price and availability, and new technologies. The communities that grow up to house them feel these shifts as challenges. They need to accommodate not just the workers as miners, but provide for their families and develop into freestanding communities. To understand how this works, we can look at Canada’s Labrador Trough, an iron-mining region in the provinces of Labrador and Quebec.  </p>

        <section id="introduction-a" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp1a" title="Historical Background">
            <h3>Historical Background</h3>
            <p>On the western edge of Labrador, along the Quebec border, in the taiga forests of the subarctic, lie the richest deposits of iron ore in North America. At the core of this mining district is the urban complex of Labrador City, founded in 1961 by the Iron Ore Company Canada (IOC)(www.ironore.ca. 2019). With a metropolitan population of some 12,000, and its satellite suburbs of adjacent Wabush, Labrador, and Fermont in Quebec, Labrador City serves as the economic and cultural center of Western Labrador astride the newly completed Trans-Labrador Highway, Route 500 to Goose Bay and Cartwright on the eastern shore of Labrador. 
            </p>
            
            
             <div id="figure1" class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/figure1.jpg);"></div>
            
            <p>The vast expanse of western Labrador and northern Quebec has been largely vacant territory from the earliest explorations in the 16th and 17th centuries, occupied primarily byu the First Nations of Ungarva in small settlements thinly scattered across the area. While the coastal shores of Labrador had been known to Basque fishermen in the late 15th century, and shores of Hudson Bay charted by the English in the 17th century, the interior remained unknown to both the French in Quebec and the English of Newfoundland. Only in the 19th century was there any effort by missionaries and government surveyors to chart the interior tracts. In part, the ignorance resulted from the confusion of territorial claim by Quebec and Newfoundland after the Confederation of Canada in 1867. Northern Quebec province (Nord de Quebec) from Hudson Bay east was declared as the District of Ungava in 1895 including part of British Labrador, while Newfoundland, then a Dominion of Britain, claimed all the territory from coastal Labrador west to the headwaters of Atlantic rivers. The debate between Quebec and Newfoundland was not settled until 1927 with the arbitration of the British Privy Council that ruled in favor of Newfoundland for the headwaters of Atlantic coastal streams in Labrador (White 1914, Dorion 1991). While Quebec still claimed interior territory, the contention was not fully resolved until 1949 when Newfoundland and Labrador became a province of Canada (Wikipedia “Labrador” 2018). The result was a sinuous boundary line between Quebec and Labrador running through the metropolitan area of Labrador City and the iron-mining district. <br>
	The exploration of mining prospects in this First Nations area of the Canadian Shield of Labrador and Quebec began only in the mid-19th century with reports by French missionaries from Sépt-Iles, a fishing village on the north bank (Cote du Nord) of the St. Lawrence River.  In 1866, Father Louis Babel reported “abundant en fer” (abundant iron) in his explorations of the interior. Later, in 1892-1895, A.P. Low working for the Geological Survey of Canada mapped the outlines of the “Labrador Trough” of iron rich ore along the Quebec-Labrador border (Bergeron 1965; Geren and McCullough 1990; Neal 2000). The iron belt extends (1000 mi/1600km) from the northern Ungava Peninsula in Quebec, through western Labrador to east-central Quebec in a sedimentary syncline of metamorphic-volcanic rocks of Proterozoic age (1.8my), one of the largest known reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world (Bergeron 1965).  <br>
	Knowledge of the rich iron ore in Labrador and Quebec became critical after the Second World War with the exhaustion of the Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota (Geren and McCullough 1990). At this point, attention turned to the potential of mining the ores of the Labrador Trough. Beginning in 1945 a consortium of American and Canadian steel companies formed the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) in 1949 to explore and mark claims for open pit mining in Labrador and Quebec (Geren and McCullough 1990). The decision was made to build a railroad, the Quebec North Shore & Labrador Railway (QNS&L) north from the St. Lawrence port of Sépt-Iles (359mi/573km) to the new town of Shefferville on the Quebec-Labrador border. Construction started in 1950 and was completed to Shefferville in 1954 to transport the iron concentrate. It was the first such long distance mining railway built in North America since the 19th century (Smith and Greenwood 1960). Shefferville remained an active mining center through the 1970s with a population of 5,000 until 1982 when operations ceased and the town was dismantled (Wikipedia “Shefferville” 2018).

            <p> Compiling a booklet describing people’s plant knowledge as a method of sustaining their knowledge and
                thus motivating conservation, begs the question…will it work? A written record now exists, so the
                ethnobotanical information will not be lost. The book is aesthetically pleasing, and is accessible even
                to those who are illiterate. Having the first language in the book written in their tribal language,
                Kiha, turned out to be even more important that we imagined at the outset. We also learned that having
                the process be so public drew more people into participating. In the short term, the project definitely
                achieved the intended goals of stimulating cultural knowledge and ecosystem awareness. Follow up studies
                such as plant list checks, age of villagers in reference to plant knowledge, and looking at the number
                of people in the village with general and specific ethnobotanical knowledge, will determine whether this
                sort of undertaking will translate in the longer term into conservation drivers.</p>
