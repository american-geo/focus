            <div class="caption"><i>View from a bay-side fishing village on Punghwailju-ro (ro is street), Sanyang-eup (eup is district), Tongyeong-si (si is city), Gyeongsangnam-do (do is province), South Korea.</i></div>
                
                <p>
                During the summer of 2017, I was traveling around South Korea as a part of a delegation of U.S. educators whose job was to prepare lesson plans for the new National Atlas of Korea Volumes II and III. I am a high school geography teacher in Tennessee and my main focus for the two-week trip was on getting a better understanding of education and population in South Korea. For the previous National Atlas of Korea Volume I, I developed a lesson plan on South Korea’s aging population and declining birth rate. All three volumes of The National Atlas of Korea, my lesson plan, and three other lesson plans from three other high school geography teachers can be freely downloaded (in public domain) from: http://nationalatlas.ngii.go.kr/pages/page_1.php. Six more lesson plans are currently being developed and shall also be posted on the same website when completed. Volume IV, titled The National Atlas of Korea: Comprehensive Edition, is written specifically for use for secondary education in geography and social studies. It is expected to be published to the same website in Spring 2018. All volumes are written in both Korean and English languages. U.S. and all English-speaking geography and social studies teachers, especially Advanced Placement Human Geography teachers, are encouraged to download the public domain atlases and adopt these lesson plans for use in their classrooms. 
				</p><p>
                During the trip to South Korea, we were able to visit some of the rural areas of the country to see firsthand the impact that a severely declining birth rate and an increasing elderly population can have on such vulnerable communities, and especially on their schools.
                </p><p>
                The sad reality is that many of South Korea’s rural communities are dying, or at the very least on life-support. The opportunities for a better living, better jobs, better housing, and more conveniences can be found in more populated urban areas of South Korea. Many young people who grow up in rural areas move to the cities and suburbs seeking these opportunities. 
                </p><p>
                The following excerpt by Choe Sang-Hun in her <i>New York Times</i> article, <i>As South Korean Villages Empty, More Primary Schools Face Closings</i>,” details the reality for many of the small towns and villages across South Korea:
                </p><p>
                <i style="text-indent: 0"><small>“Villages around here have no more children to send,” the school’s only teacher, Lee Sung-kyun, said recently, looking over an empty, weed-filled playground surrounded by old cherry trees. “Young people have all gone to cities to find work and get married there.”
                <br>
                Most South Koreans now live in the tall apartment buildings that are spread out like dominoes across South Korean cities, but many still bemoan the shrinking of rural communities.
                </small></i>
            	</p><p>
                The same can be said for many of the rural communities in Tennessee where I grew up. I did what so many South Koreans did; I moved to a bigger city because of a better job opportunity. Unfortunately for my small town, many of my classmates did the same, and the town’s growth has stagnated. So when we traveled to some of these rural South Korean communities, I could see a lot of similarities with my own hometown in southern middle Tennessee.
            	</p><p>
                A good example of this is that the high school that I attended has, in the last several years, continually dropped in enrollment to the point that it is currently in the small-school classification in the state of Tennessee. The same is happening to many of the schools across South Korea. With their enrollment dropping, their future and the future of the community of which they are a part of are uncertain. This article will provide a snapshot of three different schools in South Korea: 1) A small elementary school in a rural fishing village, 2) a closed elementary school in an inland agricultural community, and 3) a high school in the urban area of Seoul. Together, these paint an interesting picture of the impact of demographic changes that have been occurring throughout South Korea.

			<h3>Sanyang Elementary School</h3>
            <div id="figure2" class="figure contain" style="background-size: 120% auto; background-position: 0% 0%; background-image:url(img/fig2.jpg);"></div>

                <i>Street address sign of the school and the Google Map location of the school at two different scales.</i>
                <br><br>
                The first elementary school I want to discuss is the Sanyang Elementary School. A picture of a street sign that indicated “388 Punghwailju-ro” led me to find and understand the Korean description of an address location.            
                <br>
                As with many projects, it was easy to get distracted from the main topic. I didn’t know exactly what Punjhwailju-ro was, and when I finally located the school on Google Maps I was even more confused, or maybe intrigued, in trying to read the address. As someone who spends much of my time teaching and learning geography, I had found a list of places that I wanted—or even needed—to understand. 
                <br>
                When I located the school I just didn’t understand how to read the address, but fortunately in the age of the Internet the answer was just a few clicks away. I found the website “South Korea Postal Code” (https://kor.youbianku.com), and it broke down the address so that I could actually make sense of it.  The complete locational description of the school is: 388 Punghwailju-ro (ro is street), Sanyang-eup (eup is district), Tongyeong-si (si is city), Gyeongsangnam-do (do is province), South Korea. Now that I understood that South Korean addresses were broken down from street, to district, to city, to province, and finally to country, I understood exactly where the school was located by address. Other administrative subdivisions include gun (county) and three different subdivisions of eup, namely myeon, gu, and dong.

            <br><br>
                The most intriguing part of this school is that there are only 9 student and 4 teachers. Yes that is correct: there are only nine students in the entire school: eight boys and one girl. The student-teacher ratio is obviously great! This photo shows all the member of the school. However, as can be easily imagined, the per student cost of operating and maintaining this school is also very high. But the geographic reality is that rural communities are so far from urban centers that children from remaining rural communities have such great difficulties in every aspect of attending an urban school.

            <p>
                What is happening in these rural communities and that their schools will almost surely close in the next few years? Karl Schultz explains in his article, “The End of South Korea’s Rural Schools,” about the reality for many of the rural schools in one of which he is a teacher:
                <br>
                    <small><i>The elderly residents of Anpyeong literally grew up with the school, which was founded in 1952. It is the only symbol of youth in a blighted, aging town. For the few student-age residents that remain, having a local school means they can still live at home and do not have to deal with a long daily commute.<br>
                    A school in each town may have made sense in the 1950s and 1960s, when most of these schools were being built, but they don’t make as much sense today. In 1955, for example, Anpyeong Middle School graduated 117 students (its first graduating class). Today, that number has shrunk to just two students per year.</i></small>

            <p>
                It remains to be seen how long the small elementary school with only nine students can survive and stay open, but when you look at this small fishing village there are few offerings for the nine young students when they finally graduate from school. There are limited jobs and few people their own age. For many people, there is little appealing about a quiet life in an isolated village populated by a majority of elderly people.

            <p>
                In some communities of Korea, there are already too few students for a school to be in operation. While driving through the rice fields in southern South Korea, we drove up to a place called Gurek-Gumnenzip. In Korean that means “house of making pottery.” When we went inside we could see that, in what was previously elementary classrooms, there were now classes set up to teach people how to make pottery.

            <br><br>
                Although the school had been re-purposed as a place to learn how to make pottery, the overall look of the school stood in stark comparison to the beautiful, manicured, well-kept Sanyang Elementary School on Punjhwailju-ro. It unfortunately took me back to my own hometown in rural Tennessee. The elementary school I attended as a child has also long been closed, and it has been everything from a flea market to a cheerleader uniform factory to a dancehall. Currently it is up for sale, showing its many years of neglect.

            <br><br>
                The former Daehak Elementary looked no better than my old elementary school. There were weeds and overgrown shrubs surrounding the school. It had definitely seen better days. Although there were the pottery classes in some of the old classrooms of the former school, upon walking inside one was struck with a sense of loss. It is sad when a community loses its school, because the school is the one place that bonds all of the people of the town. It is the one place they all have in common.

                As I was walking out of the school, I could see a car and a tent in front of the school. The school grounds have been multi-purposed for car camping. Looking on the bright side, at least the former school is still−for the moment−being used by the community. It would have been worse had it been completely abandoned.
                <br>
                Leaving the rural areas of southern South Korea, we headed back to the urban jungle which is Seoul. As mentioned earlier, it is to the cities that the youth of the villages are moving in hopes of better opportunities. The problem with schools losing students is not only a rural Korean problem, however. There are very real associated problems in the urban areas as well. The younger generation is under great economic pressure when they move to the cities where the cost of living is so much higher. More often than not, they are choosing a career first and marriage later, if at all; obviously delaying or not considering childbirth. 
                <br>
                This fact is not lost on the government of South Korea, as it has invested millions of dollars in programs with the sole purpose of boosting the country’s birth rate. The government recognizes that raising a child in the modern ultra-developed world that is now South Korea is extremely expensive. With tax breaks, monetary incentives, work incentives, paid leave, etc., the government is trying to make it easier for South Koreans to choose to have more children. Only time will tell if any of these actions will truly lead to South Koreans’ having more children.

            <p>
                At the third and final school we visited during our trip, it does not seem to have increasing number of students. In the Vice-Principal’s office at Yongmoon High School in Seoul, there was a chalk- board with the number of classes offered for each year. In grade 3 (the oldest students of the three classes shown on the board), there are thirteen total classes, and in grade 2 there are twelve total classes. In grade 1, the youngest students in the school, there are only eleven total classes. Each year there are fewer and fewer students. Unlike the previous elementary schools discussed, Yongmoon High School is not in danger of closing anytime soon, but the alarm bells should still be sounding, because the demographic issues plaguing rural South Korea are alive and well in the urban areas also.

            <p>
                There is no golf classroom at Yongmoon High School, because high school in South Korea is all work and more work. I had a student a few years ago in my class who had just moved to the United States from Seoul. I asked him what it was like to be a teenager in Seoul. His response was a bit startling. “Being a student in South Korea is no fun. Life is no fun. All you do is study.” To be fair, this student was extremely motivated and ambitious, so I am sure for him this was very true.
                <br>
                In her BBC article, South Korea’s Schools: Long Days, High Results, journalist Reeta Chakrabarti documents the day in the life of a teenager in one of Seoul’s affluent neighborhoods of Gangnam:<br><br>
                <small>
                    Hye-Min Park is 16 and lives in the affluent Seoul district of Gangnam, made famous by the pop star Psy. Her day is typical of that of the majority of South Korean teenagers.<br>
                    She rises at 6.30am, is at school by 8am, finishes at 4pm, (or 5pm if she has a club), then pops back home to eat.
                    <br>
                    She then takes a bus to her second school shift of the day, at a private crammer or hagwon, where she has lessons from 6pm until 9pm.
                    <br>
                    She spends another two hours in what she calls self-study back at school, before arriving home after 11pm. She goes to bed at 2am, and rises in the morning at 6.30am to do it all over again.

            <br><br>
                When walking down the hallway at Yongmoon High School during a time when students had a short break, I was surprised to see so many students sleeping. However, after I learned about the typical day of a student (above) it should not be too surprising that Korean students are often times exhausted, over-worked, and over-stressed. Their job is to study in order to pass their exams so that they can ensure that they are granted entrance into a good university.

                <i>Students at Yongmoon High School, Seoul, South Korea. They are all very attentive and well-behaved.</i>
            <br><br>
                The students we observed were well-behaved and attentive through the class instruction (Figure 21). They realize a successful future in South Korea means being a successful student in school. Here lies another obstacle for the South Korean government with improving its birth rate: to have a child in South Korea means needing to prepare a child with the best education possible, and with all of the extra tutoring and classes, it becomes very expensive to raise a successful child in South Korea.
                <br>
                What changes can be made to reverse this demographic time bomb that South Korea is experiencing? The simple answer is for the people of South Korea to have more children. Simple as it may sound, the developed countries of the world need to look at countries like South Korea, Japan, and Singapore. What is happening with their populations could eventually be a major issue for the world’s other highly developed countries. We can already see similar demographic issues plaguing the rural areas of America. If it weren’t for our relatively generous immigration policies in the USA, we could be finding ourselves with the same problems now facing South Korea: a declining work force and an increasing dependent elderly population.

                In South Korea, there are subtle changes you see as you travel around the country. You see reserved seating for pregnant women on the subway. You will see bathrooms for pregnant women only, and in some situations you will see the best parking spaces might also be reserved for pregnant women.

                What South Korea does to (hopefully) turn the tide and return closer to that ideal two-child household should be of major importance to those of us in the United States. What may lead to their success may be what we could have to do in the not-so-near future for our own success.
