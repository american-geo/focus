                    Can Making a Book Conserve a Forest? Bubango, Tanzania</h2>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>When elders pass away, often their knowledge goes with them. We decided to create a booklet as a way to keep traditional information alive. We set out to make a collaborative record of Ha plant use (ethnobotany), in the village of Bubango, located in western Tanzania. Through community meetings, stemming from one of the author’s relationship with the community for over a decade, they wrote a letter of invitation for us to come and work with their community on this ethnobotanical project. We worked for three months daily with the village, and completed the booklet and presented the finished product at the end of this time period.  The booklet itself is solely for the villagers and locals in the surrounding area. As the information is theirs, any further sharing of the product is at the locals’ discretion. The authors chose Bubango for this initial project, because this community had expressed interest over the years, and because of their proximity to important natural resources that would benefit from the community’s conservation awareness. The village borders the miombo woodland of Gombe Stream National Park and Lake Tanganyika. Gombe is a valuable strip of chimpanzee habitat made famous by the behavioral research program of Jane Goodall. Lake Tanganyika is a fresh body of water which supports abundant life and upon which many villages depend. As with any community living in forests, deforestation is almost always an issue. Although these villagers are conscious not to over cut for planting or to overhunt, forest loss is still a significant issue. When biodiversity declines, the ethnobotanical knowledge of the ecosystem drops as well. This reality seems to be affecting nearly all rural communities.This distancing diminishes peoples’ connection to the natural world, and thus their impetus to protect their environment. When people understand how to use their plants, the value of those particular species rises. Thus, when they value the plants, they also come to value the entire ecosystem, and place a greater emphasis on conservation. </p>

                <h3>Skin lightening products </h3>
                <p>Streetscapes are turned into places of discrimination when billboards display the message of colorism, glorifying fair skin (<a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>). The seemingly omnipresent advertisements not only on billboards, but also in newspapers, magazines, the internet and on TV tell people how successful they will become if they use skin lightening products. The message in the advertisement on the billboard in Figures 1 and 13 is “<i>Din-e Din Total Fairness</i>” (Day by Day, Total Fairness). The image is of a young woman dancing after 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and finally with the supposedly right look after 28 days of using a skin lightening cream. In a commercial that ran on TV in Bangladesh some years ago, a woman was depicted in different situations to demonstrate how she became increasingly successful in many aspects of her life the longer she used the skin lightening product. Similarly, an analysis of television advertisements of fairness products in India found them to “connect fairness with achieving other personal goals, such as marriage, success, empowerment, job opportunities, and confidence.” (Karan 2008, 1) The contrast in skin tone between the photo models and the common people represents an unattainable ideal of physical appearance that leaves many people with low self-esteem, frustrated, and eager to buy whatever product is being advertised.</p>

                <p>Globally, the production and sale of skin lightening products has become a booming industry. “In 2017, the global skin-lightening industry was worth $4.8bn (£3.4bn), and it is projected to grow to $8.9bn by 2027…Skin-lightening products include creams, scrubs, pills and even injections designed to slow the production of melanin.” (Khan 2018) The Asia-Pacific region has the fastest growing market for skin lightening products worldwide, explained by prevalent colorism in most Asian communities, with fairness products sold to both women and men, and increased spending on cosmetics among the growing middle class (Global Industry Analysts, 2018). </p>
                <p>The use of skin lightening products is accompanied by many health risks. “The main adverse effect of the inorganic mercury contained in skin lightening soaps and creams is kidney damage. Mercury in skin lightening products may also cause skin rashes, skin discoloration and scarring, as well as a reduction in the skin’s resistance to bacterial and fungal infections. Other effects include anxiety, depression or psychosis and peripheral neuropathy.” (World Health Organization 2011, 2). Not only are the people who use the products themselves exposed to health risks, but a lot of people are also affected indirectly, as toxins from the skin lightening products end up in waterways and seafood. </p>
                <p style="padding:10px">
                    “Mercury in soaps, creams and other cosmetic products is eventually discharged into wastewater. The mercury then enters the environment, where it becomes methylated and enters the food-chain as the highly toxic methylmercury in fish. Pregnant women who consume fish containing methylmercury transfer the mercury to their fetuses, which can later result in neurodevelopmental deficits in the children” (World Health Organization 2011, 2).

                    Skin lightening products are very common in Bangladesh, and they are sold over the counter in cosmetic stores, gift stores, and grocery stores (<a href="#figure14">Figure 14</a>). </p>

                <p>
                    There are over 2000 beauty parlors in Bangladesh, most of which offer “brightening facials, fair polish or bleach that promise lighter skin” (Amreen 2019). Measured by mercury content, Bangladesh is at the very top of the list of 22 sampled countries where skin lightening products are popular and easily available, as almost 50% of the creams sampled and tested in Bangladesh had mercury levels exceeding the established safety limit (European Environmental Bureau 2018, 15). One of my research participants had worked for an international cosmetics company in Bangladesh, whereby she had made up her mind on skin lightening products based on what she had learned:
                </p>

                    They should ban the products! Everybody knows it’s not good for you, but nobody says anything. Not only Fair&Lovely, also Garnier and other brands. They promise a light skin tone… No such products should be legal. When I worked in [my company], I read that using those chemicals for a long time, you can get cancer. This was a confidential source, in 2004. … There is another brand name: FEM, from India, it’s actually a bleaching cream. It’s available everywhere in Bangladesh. Usually boys wouldn’t say they use it, but they do. Maybe 80% of users are boys, but [they] won’t admit it. My female friends use those. The creams lighten the facial hairs, which lasts for a day or two. Fair&Lovely is very creamy, a cream coat in the face, so you look lighter, but you go in the sun, and it goes away. <br>
                    Q: If there are no results, why do they use them? <br>
                    A: Mental satisfaction. And they believe they will eventually become fairer. One cream is called “Fairever” or something like that. My friend has used it for years, and she feels she can see a difference, but we can’t! …<br>
                    Q: Did you ever try any of those products? <br>
                    A: No, I never tried those products, except once, but I got a burning sensation, and I washed it off. It was “Fairever” or something, from India. I wasn’t feeling the wind in my face, I sweated. You’re supposed to keep it on, all times. It leads to problems with your skin—you get pimples, and so on. (32-year-old woman)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Bangladesh there is no legislation requiring ingredients to be listed on cosmetic product labels, but there are some guidelines. The Minamata Convention provisions for cosmetics have been integrated into the national legislation, but enforcement is insufficient, as skin-lightening creams containing more than the established maximum level of mercury are still on the market (European Environmental Bureau 2018, 42). Shyam B. Verma, a dermatologist in India, points at a problem which seems to also be prevalent in Bangladesh: “Companies manufacturing skin lightening products take advantage of the lax advertising laws and make unsubstantiated claims about their efficacy” (Verma 2010, 465). One of my participants commented on Bangladesh’s lax labeling practices:
                </p>
                <p style="padding:10px">
                    There are special bleach products—you may end up getting cancer. …. There is no warning on labels. Many may not even know that they could get cancer. But even when they know it they’ll use [the products] because they cannot handle the pressure. (40-year-old woman)

                </p>
                <p>
                    There are probably many reasons why there is so little focus on the risks associated with skin lightening products. One reason may be that discrimination based on complexion is not usually talked about as a problem, leaving a lot of people suffering in silence. A female participant who self-identifies as <i>kalo</i> (black) told me that she had never before talked openly and in–depth about such discrimination with anyone:
                </p>

                <p style="padding: 10px">

                    We don’t talk about these things with others. Back home [in Bangladesh] nobody talks about it. You cannot talk about it—not with your friends. I never talked with anyone about this. Not even my [dark-skinned] sister. <br>
                    Q: Why? <br>
                    A: We want to pretend the problem is not there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If discrimination based on skin color is not generally talked about, it may be hard to spark a debate on how to end such discrimination. However, when asked, respondents shared their ideas.

            <section id="1g" class="scene" data-scene-id="lp4" title="Respondents’ suggestions for how to reduce colorism">
                <h3>Respondents’ suggestions for how to reduce colorism</h3>
                <p>The older participants expressed stronger beliefs in education as a change agent, and the younger participants expressed stronger beliefs in popular media, such as the internet and TV. Media of all kinds in South Asia use light-skinned models, actors, and news anchors, to the detriment of dark-skinned people’s self-esteem. Promoting dark-skinned models and actors would be the way to go: “We should have some kind of campaign in Bangladesh, and all over South Asia, [stating] that beauty can come in so many colors.” (39-year-old man). </p>
                <p>Not all participants believe it will be possible to create cultural change to such an extent that attitudes about skin color will change. One woman in Bangladesh said that she talks with her young son about these things and try to instill in him a respect for people regardless of their skin tone, but she doesn’t believe that it will be possible to instill such values across the board in Bangladeshi society. Also, she emphasized the social stratification in Bangladesh, by saying: </p>
                <p style="padding: 10px">
                    People will say “you are <i>boro lok</i> (rich, influential people), you can do whatever you want. But we are not rich, we cannot afford to have a dark daughter”. It’s related with poverty, so it’s complicated. (40-year-old woman)
                </p>
                <p>What she implies is that for a poor person, marrying a dark-skinned person may be so costly in terms of future dowry payments to the grooms of your daughters that it will have devastating economic effects for generations to come.
                    Another participant feels there is a difference between urban and rural areas:
                </p>
                <p style="padding: 10px">A lot has to happen. It has changed a lot though. In the past, dark girls would never get [marriage] proposals. Things are changing. When the older generation dies out, it will change. But in rural areas I don’t know. They don’t know that girls can be beautiful with dark skin tones. (32-year-old woman).</p>
                <p>Among the participants in my research, young women who self-identified as <i>kalo</i> (black/dark) had experienced less discrimination in a diasporic setting in the US than in their home country, and one woman said that she had been made to feel content about her own looks while staying here. She said that in the US she is appreciated for who she is, her qualifications, job experience, and so on, without having to worry about receiving negative comments about her skin tone: </p>
                <p style="padding: 10px">
                    I don’t have to be self-conscious anymore. I can be who I am…You don’t feel you’re scrutinized constantly. Here they do not care, that’s the nice thing. …That helped me so much….[Americans] like your skin tone. People are cherishing you. Someone said to me, “Your skin tone is so beautiful. Even if I tan, I would never get the skin color like you have.” (35-year-old woman)
                </p>
                <p>However, aside from this positive anecdote, the mental pain and suffering that seems to be so commonly experienced by dark-skinned people and especially dark-skinned females in Bangladesh, should be given more focus in academia, schools, media and other arenas, with an aim to build more empathy and critical thinking skills to enable people to avoid the brainwashing that the bombardment of comments, advertisements and entertainment amounts to. Everyone should be appreciated for who they are, not what color their skin happens to be.</p>
