                    The typical tour of (the Hashemite Kingdom of) Jordan usually includes three main sites: Amman’s
                    citadel (and its downtown souks), Petra, and Wadi Rum – all indeed spectacular, and the latter two
                    UNESCO World Heritage sites (WHS). The more ambitious tourist might also visit Jerash, Ajloun, a
                    resort at the Dead Sea, maybe a hot spring or Wadi Dana, and perhaps a few religious sites such as
                    Bethany Beyond the Jordan, Mt. Nebo, Madaba, and the Red Sea. A few more days and some digging
                    online might lead to Jordan’s castle circuit: <span style="font-style: italic;">Kharana</span> (most
                    likely a caravanserai), <span style="font-style: italic;">Amra</span>(a UNESCO WHS with unique
                    Islamic frescoes), <span style="font-style: italic;">Azraq</span> (where T.H. Lawrence and his
                    comrades wintered), Kerak and Shobak (infamous Crusader castles), and Umm ar-Rasas (another UNESCO
                    WHS) mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments. All these places together, however, barely
                    scratch the surface of Jordan’s innumerable ancient and important sites.
                    <br /><br />I first visited Jordan as part of an undergraduate study abroad program in 1995. We
                    spent only a couple days in the country: a few hours in Wadi Rum and an overnight in Petra. I
                    returned 20 years later as a Fulbright Scholar, initially to identify indicator species to help
                    establish biomes in the Wadi Dana Biosphere Reserve. But once there, as with many field-based
                    projects, my focus changed and broadened to document the Kingdom’s Eastern Desert ruins.
                    Jordan’s Eastern Desert has an extraordinary historical and archaeological heritage that spans
                    multiple occupational periods from pre-Roman to the present day, but many of its sites are almost
                    entirely unknown and/or lack formal archaeological assessment. My own search for documentation on
                    them turned up exactly three studies. Mainly I learned of other sites by pouring over (old) maps,
                    (out-of-date) guidebooks, conversing with locals, and tapping colleagues engaged in other Eastern
                    Desert research efforts (e.g., biological assessments, refugee relief, etc.). These sites are a
                    tremendous cultural asset and could be a much needed economic benefit to the country, appealing to
                    those seeking intellectually rigorous adventure travel.

                    Qasr Khan-az-Zahib (N 31.51339 E 36.10130 – az-Zahib to the west, the Crusader fort to the east).
                    This ruin represents the spark of my interest in Jordan’s forgotten fortresses. It took me the
                    better part of a day to find it, as, like most of the qasr I “discovered”, it was just a dot on an
                    old map. As I was taking photos, a young Bedouin herder, perhaps 10-years old, came over to me with
                    some tea. He said these were Roman-era ruins (L1030058, upper-left) and, just behind some rubble,
                    there was another fortress from the Crusader era (straight “walls” far-right in image). The rubble
                    in between the two sites (image-left) represents looting pits. Sadly, this is a problem all over
                    Jordan. With limited funds focused on the more established sites, ruins and looting pits often go
                    hand-in-hand in the Kingdom.

                    for forgotten qasr, they often look like a pile of rocks until you clamber over them.

                    After photographing the two sites, I discovered toppled ancient columns and capitals and dressed
                    stone, supporting the Bedouin boy’s statement that this was a Roman era fortress.

                    The opening to a natural cistern (N 31.51408 E 36.10265), with Qasr az-Zahib in the background
                    (L1030056, upper-center-right). The Bedouin boy said the cistern was built during the Roman era, and
                    still serves as the regional herders’ water source today. Note the livestock in the background

                    Qasr Usaykhim (N 31.94592 E 36.95215). Looking to the east while driving along highway 5 from Azraq
                    to al-Safawi, a casual observer might notice a faint outcrop in the distance and mistake it for a
                    small cinder cone volcano (L1030367). This is the black desert after all, so-named for
                    late-Neogene/early-Pleistocene basalt flows covering the area that has resulted in such sharp rocks
                    that even camels won’t traverse it (the white-ish colored splotches on the rocks are lichen).

                    It is possible to drive up to Qasr Usaykhim’s entrance if you have a vehicle with decent ground
                    clearance (L1030306). In fact, there are faint vehicle trails scattered around the entire area, as
                    goat herders use the region throughout the year.

                    The dusty Bedouin-made tracks, however, are not for the faint of heart, as the road is rough, and
                    the climb to the entrance is steep (L103030). The sharp basalt rocks also wreak havoc on tires for
                    the uninitiated desert driver.

                    Fortifications surrounding Qasr Usaykhim (L1030263). These walls, averaging about 1 meter high and 1
                    meter wide with occasional L-shaped, almost interlocking openings every few dozen meters, weave
                    around the hillside in a teardrop shape (see aerial view). Presumably, these date to the same time

                    Perched on top of the outcrop – which is indeed, a cinder cone remnant – sits Qasr Usaykhim, a 3rd
                    century BC fortress (L1030245). Most likely Roman in origin (as denoted by the archways) but, as
                    with all forgotten qasr, subsequently used during Crusader and Ottoman times. Three still-intact
                    arches at this qasr highlight Roman architectural prowess.

                    for another structure, as it hosts angular blocks of basalt (center) similar to the those used in
                    the qasr’s construction (toppled, angular blocks of the fortress in the background).

                    the background (upper-left) is a modern cinder quarry (N 31.95449 E 36.91063). The fort’s

                    Dayr al-Kahf (“Cave Monastery”, N 32.28109 E 36.83810). Often overshadowed by its neighbor, Umm
                    al-Jimal, just a day’s camel ride northwest of Usaiykhim and a scant three kilometers south of the
                    Syrian border, sits the qasr of Dayr al-Kahf (L1030405). Built with local basalt like Qasr Usaiykhim
                    (as opposed to limestone like its nearest neighbor to the west, Umm al-Jimal) it is thought Dayr
                    al-Kahf functioned as a Roman sentry post in the 4th century. Its still-standing Roman arch
                    (far-left) lends credence to this idea.

                    (L1030428). Looking north-northwest, this image’s horizon marks the current Jordan-Syrian border.
                    Note the large “hole” in the image’s center. Dug a few meters deep with plastered walls directly in
                    the fort’s center, this functioned as a cistern. An archaeological excavation occurred here in the
                    1980s, but no research since. The lone caretaker with the only key (center, in white and red
                    kafieyeh) was more than happy to play tour guide, and invited us to his house – a very typical thing
                    for a Jordanian to do – for lebn, a very salty and thick yogurt-ish drink made from goat’s milk (and
                    an acquired taste). While I find most people generally hospitable and helpful wherever I travel,
                    Jordanians seem to go the extra mile. They are the most genuinely considerate, welcoming, generous,
                    and friendly people I have yet to encounter in my travels.

                    traveled beyond it a few times in his so-far long life – explained that until the 1980s, people used
                    the Dayr al-Kahf as living quarters. This is evinced by the mud-and-straw plaster remnants on the
                    walls, ceilings, and archways. Around the country, as tourism became an ever-increasingly-important
                    economic sector, the government built nearby villages to relocate many locals who at that time
                    inhabited historic sites (like Dayr al-Kahf and even Petra), to new villages built for them. In some
                    regions this worked well, in others, the historically populated village/location became a ghost
                    town.

                    (L1030402) Re-used roman columns give further evidence of both Roman construction and occupation, as
                    well as local residences. While obviously the columns and their sections do not match, the locals
                    used what they could find to create this entranceway into their village – an example of what some
                    call “Bedouin Ingenuity”. The locals are masters at using whatever they have on hand to remedy a
                    perceived problem. (Dayr al-Kahf’s key master and my wife standing in the entrance).

                    Qasr Ashid (N 31.52067 E 36.31911). From the rubble pile, it is not too difficult to imagine how
                    this qasr must have looked when in use (L1030089). Still, after identifying several potential
                    locations, this was a coincidental discovery en route to finding another (Qasr Qilat). Being lost in
                    the Eastern Desert is exciting. For the first few hours. Even if you find a “road”, it may not lead
                    to anywhere specific. That is how I found Qasr Ashid. Cresting a small mountain, I saw two herders
                    sitting on top of this pile of rocks. I stopped, got out of my truck, and walked over to ask
                    directions to Qasr Qilat. They just stared at each other for a moment, and then pointed around them.
                    Imagine my surprise when they said they were sitting on a qasr!

                    Over tea, the two herders told me these were Ottoman outposts, but that maybe Romans had originally
                    built them. Being on top of mountain, I imagined Ottoman (and Roman turrets scattered across the
                    surrounding points). Lending credence to the herders’ assumptions, I found this “dressed” stone –
                    one of many – in the rubble pile (L1030077). The scratch marks are indicative of Roman architectural
                    techniques.

                    Here, in the rubble pile, are a few interesting stones (L1030085). The stone on top of all the
                    others with the convex, smooth face is in fact one of several partial pillar pieces discovered in
                    the rubble pile. The stone directly underneath it (bottom-center) has some ancient etching, too
                    decayed to decipher. The other stone with engravings (upper-middle-right) hosts a multitude of
                    inscriptions, but has yet to be translated. Directly above that stone (upper-right-hand corner) is
                    another convex-shaped stone, potentially part of a pillar. After showing me a supposed entrance to
                    crawl into and under the rubble pile (I did not have the right equipment), they suggested I drive
                    down the mountain towards the reservoir.

                    Qasr Qilat (N 31.50162 E 36.40941). On my way down the mountainside, I met a young boy relaxing in
                    the shade of a large water tanker. I asked him if he knew where Qilat was, and he just stared at me.
                    After explaining to him as best I could, he suggested we visit with his grandpa, and hopped in my
                    truck, pointing the way. After a half-hour or so, we pulled up to a Bedouin herder’s tent, and out
                    walked an older man. His son told him what I asked, and he nodded, jumped in my truck, and pointed.
                    After another half-hour of rough terrain driving, I saw a lone tree at the end of good-sized
                    reservoir (L1030105). </p>

                <p>
                    A few moments later, he told me to stop. I asked him where Qilat was, and he said, houn (“here”),
                    pointing to the dam. As I looked at the dam, he told me the Romans built it, and that every ruling
                    people after took advantage of the resource, adding to and strengthening the dam. Standing on top of
                    the dam, surveying the landscape (L1030097), my Bedouin Guide says this reservoir represents the
                    only potable water source for miles in any direction – and the only greenery, including a small
                    riparian area down-dam that extends for a kilometer or so downstream.

                    Skeptical of his assessment that Romans built the dam, I went searching for evidence. I found
                    several dressed stones (L1030121 – scratches to the right of the pen [for scale]) and even a couple
                    remnants of pillars (L1030124). However, these could have been moved from an adjacent site, merely
                    being reused by later peoples. But my guide insists. Wallah? (“really”?), I say, and he motions for
                    me to get back in the truck.

                    Driving downstream a kilometer or so, he tells me to stop, and walks me over to a cliff side. As I
                    look down the small canyon, he points beneath our feet. There, scattered across the rocks, are
                    several small divots (L1030138). Note my keys for scale. I recognize these from Petra, Azraq,
                    Jerash, and other Roman-inhabited sites around the Middle East. Used for a kind of mancala (board
                    game), this represents one way Roman soldiers would while away the long days of doing nothing in the
                    middle of nowhere. Bedouin kids throughout the Middle East still use ancient divots to play the same
                    game today.

                    Walking upstream a few yards, he points out another engraving (L1030145), a Romanesque cross. I have
                    seen these symbols at other Roman-inhabited sites as well, lending credence to my guide’s story that
                    Romans were here and perhaps even built the dam.

                    As the shadows become longer, and knowing I have a few hours of driving ahead of me (and not wanting
                    to drive through the desert at night), I take one last picture of the area (L1030150). We ramble
                    through the desert back to my Bedouin friend’s tent just as the sun is dipping below the horizon. He
                    asks if I want some tea, and I say no twice before finally agreeing. Watching the sun get even
                    lower, I thank him and tell him I have to go. “Stay”, he says, offering me a place in his tent. I
                    decline, noting I have to get back to Amman. He gives me his phone number, reminds me to visit
                    again, and points me in the direction of Amman. Following his azimuth, an hour after dark I turn
                    onto the main highway. A few weeks later, I learned the words qasr and qilat both mean “castle” (I
                    was asking where the “castle-castle” was?!) This explained all the blank stares. Luckily, the old
                    Bedouin man knew what I meant.

                    Jordan got the short end of the Sykes-Picot stick, the 1916 Great Powers agreement that divided the
                    Middle East into states and spheres of influence. While some states got oil, Jordan was left without
                    any real natural resource benefits. Instead, tourism remains one of its main economic prospects.
                    Thus far, Jordan has concentrated its limited funds on infrastructure, development/research, and
                    protection for the most known and accessible sites. My documentation, what archaeology colleagues
                    call “landscape archaeology”, seeks to acknowledge less known sites, helping make them accessible to
                    the perhaps more adventurous person.

                    The Eastern Desert has a wealth of ruins. More akin to fortresses than castles-proper, these
                    structures have served multiple purposes throughout their existence. Some were caravan stopovers,
                    others private getaways for Caliphs, and almost all functioned in various capacities for multiple
                    ruling peoples over long timeframes – as evinced by layered architecture, building footprints,
                    etchings in different languages at individual sites, and explanations by traditional Bedouin people
                    who have inhabited the region for generations. Locals call these ruins qasr (pl. qasour, an Arabic
                    term for “castle” or “palace” with no English equivalent and often used to denote any old stone
                    structure). And, as long as you stay away from Jordan’s neighbors’ borders (Syria, Iraq, and Saudi
                    Arabia), discovering these ruins for yourself remains relatively safe – assuming you have reliable
                    transport, decent field sense, and do not mind getting lost from time to time.

                    Jordan’s forgotten qasour remain a hidden gem. Looking at a map of the well-known sites, the main
                    qasr tourist circuit of Kharrana-Amra-Azraq all lay within a day’s walk of each other (~20km or so).
                    Interestingly, many of the forgotten qasour are separated by approximately the same distance,
                    indicating that their locations followed the same principles as the better known ones. For example,
                    traveling from Usayikhim to Azraq was a day’s journey by foot or camel. From Azraq, you could then
                    head directly west to Amman via stops at Amra, Kharanna, and Muwakkar. But you could also go from
                    Azraq to Qilat via az-Zahib, and then head south or west, following another string of qasour, to
                    Petra and the Dead Sea, respectively. Each forgotten qasr has likely been around for several hundred
                    years or more, and has been used by various peoples throughout that time. Only in the last couple of
                    centuries have they have fallen into disrepair and been all but forgotten by most people. Yet even
                    in their dilapidated state, their potential to enhance Jordan’s most important economic sector
                    (tourism) remains high, especially given the recent and fast-growing interest in adventure travel
                    experiences/tourism. With a four-wheel drive vehicle, basic field supplies, an old-fashioned paper
                    map (cell service in most parts of the Eastern Desert remains intermittent at best), a little bit of
                    Arabic language, and snacks and water, anyone can “discover” Jordan’s Forgotten Eastern Desert
                    Qasour. </p>

                    Unquestionably the newest and best buses are reserved for tourists. Two Yutong buses imported from
                    China await their groups near a popular tourist destination. Such government-owned buses are well
                    maintained and it is unusual to see Cubans on board unless they are drivers or guides. One driver
                    commented that the Chinese buses were adequate but he longed for the refinements of the Volvo bus he
                    had driven while residing in Canada. As these buses age, they will be relegated to general national
                    service and perhaps to the provinces. </p>

                    In the critical period of the 1990s after loss of Soviet-bloc subsidies, public transportation
                    experienced a decline estimated at 70%. One response was the “<span
                        style="font-style:italic;">camello</span>” (camel) bus. In some cases two older bus bodies were
                    literally welded together and attached to a large truck. This one is a bit more refined but still
                    the <span style="font-style:italic;">camello</span> marked a low point in passenger comfort as up to
                    300 riders were packed into the non-air-conditioned people-hauler. With their traditional sense of
                    humor, Cubans said of the <span style="font-style:italic;">camello</span> that each had a crew of

                    As some of the despised camellos are pulled from the streets, at least in parts of major cities, one
                    transportation mode to replace them is the <span style="font-style:italic;">camion</span>, literally
                    the truck. Reforms make it legal to carry passengers in privately owned conveyances. Essentially all
                    that is required is a functioning truck chassis and the ability to fit it with a large box.
                    Typically several benches extend most of the length of the box but many of the passengers, if not
                    most, stand up. Note the several hands holding onto the bottom of the narrow opening…one can hardly
                    call it a window. There is no provision for ventilation, visibility, sanitation, and no safety
                    features; basically there is little concern for passenger comfort. And most are packed. This may be
                    the least expensive form of mass transport over distances. </p>

                    As more tourists arrive can "Disneyesque Toy Trains" be far behind? As with several transport modes,
                    those serving the tourist seem newer and better maintained than modes intended for Cubans. There is
                    no large amusement park in which such a “train” as this would ply its trade and haul its riders.
                    However, the increasing frequency of cruise ships in Havana harbor may justify spending limited

                    The stern visage of “Revolutionary Che” carries many messages. As author of the Motorcycle Diaries
                    (<span style="font-style:italic;">Diarios de Motocicleta</span>) the young Argentine medical student
                    enjoyed the freedom of travel and discovery which contributed strongly to his social conscience and
                    determination to devote himself to revolutionary change in Latin America. Later, as a leader of the
                    Cuban Revolution Che was the most devoted, the most doctrinaire spokesperson for a socialized Cuba
                    where no person lacked for any of the elements of a good life. Yet the small motorbike reminds us
                    that today both travel and movement in Cuba are restricted both by policy and an economic system
                    that restricts personal access to resources. </p>

                    This photo essay of Cuban transportation issues seeks to convey three messages, two current and one
                    future. First, public transportation in Cuba is in crisis and has been for at least two decades. The
                    causes are multiple but clearly include a poorly administered nationalization plan, the enduring
                    U.S. Embargo, loss of Soviet-bloc assistance, lack of domestic fuel resources, and the low priority
                    given to transport by Marxist-Leninist economic philosophy. Public transportation planning, if such
                    exists, is strictly patchwork and stop-gap; donated busses, second-hand busses, used railroad cars,
                    rented airplanes are pressed into service only to succumb to a lack of parts or essential
                    maintenance.
                    <br /><br />An equally important message is the creativity of Cubans in the face of adversity, their
                    penchant to <span style="font-style: italic;">resolver</span>, to cope with deficiencies in multiple
                    aspects of daily life. Public education and public health are universally accessible but schools and
                    clinics less so owing to poor public transportation. More Cubans seem to complain about the
                    difficulty of getting to and from work or to and from shopping than any other single topic. Complain
                    they do but in a variety of ways they cope, whether it means enduring a crowded stifling bus,
                    keeping alive a vintage cacharro as a taxi, turning a truck into a bus, or packing three or more on
                    a motorcycle.
                    <br /><br />However, as leadership moves the national economy more deeply into international
                    tourism, Cuba must create a tourist-worthy transportation system. It is not enough to provide a
                    nostalgic jaunt along the <span style="font-style:italic;">Malecon</span> in a 1954 Buick
                    convertible. Most tourists expect to be delivered on time and in comfort to their chosen
                    destinations. Just as Cubans have endured a quarter century of a dual currency policy that puts most
                    at a disadvantage, it appears the country is creating a dual transportation system that has Cubans
                    in horse-drawn wagons observing tourists in shiny new Chinese busses. Classlessness is a persistent
                    Cuban priority in access to public health and education, cherished pillars of the Revolution. The
                    question is, are Cubans willing to remain an underclass in the fundamental need and right of
                    personal mobility? How will they choose to <span style="font-style: italic;">resolver</span> this
                    inequity?
