                    Kiribati is the only country in the world to straddle all four hemispheres.
                    A remote Pacific island nation, it is a place unknown to most people I meet, and the vast majority
                    of my American students.
                    If they happen to have seen it on a map they will pronounce its name incorrectly — it is pronounced
                    Kiribaas and its people
                    and language are known as i-Kiribati (ee-Kiribaas).
                    It’s better known in the eastern hemisphere and shares close historical and contemporary
                    Commonwealth ties with New Zealand
                    and Australia, who provide the country with aid, humanitarian outreach, and tourism dollars.
                    Kiribati is one of the least visited countries in the world, yet, as its cultural landscape shows,
                    it is now and has long been,
                    part of a globalized system.

                    Kiribati is made up of 21 inhabited islands on 33 atolls (and one phosphate rock island) spread over
                    a wide swath of the Pacific Ocean.
                    It includes three distinct island groups: the Gilbert, Line, and Phoenix Islands. The majority of
                    the country’s population lives on several atolls in the Gilberts.
                    There is only one permanently inhabited island in the Phoenix chain and three in the Line Islands.
                    More than half of the country’s 110,000 people
                    live on the densely populated islets in the southern portion of Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Group,
                    which is the focus of this essay.

                    Despite its remoteness Kiribati is a place linked to the rest of the world.
                    The most evident connections appear in landscapes and material culture.
                    Access to ideas, items, and income though global networks of missionaries, shipping, and global
                    humanitarian outreach frame many of the cultural landscapes in Tarawa.
                    In addition, the country’s infrastructure is as oriented to allow goods entry as it is to distribute
                    them across the country.
                    Even the name indicates foreign influence. Although Kiribati was originally called Tungaru, its
                    current name is a transliteration, into the indigenous tongue, of the word “Gilberts,” for Thomas
                    Gilbert, a British Pacific explorer.
                    Sovereign since 1979, it became part of the British Empire in 1892 and connections to the British
                    Commonwealth of Nations continue to affect everyday lives in Tarawa.
                    A short stint under Japanese imperial rule during World War II, followed by American victory in a
                    major Pacific Theater battle at Tarawa, also left a deep and lasting impression on the atoll.
                    Furthermore, Kiribati has a front seat to climate change and its impacts on vulnerable, low-lying
                    island places and populations with few resources to combat its harm.
                    Indeed, the fact that Kiribati literally touches all four hemispheres of the earth is a metaphor
                    for a country with deep and global connections.
                    <br /><br />
                    Although Tarawa is only one of the many islands in this Pacific nation, it is a good microcosm of
                    the broader country as
                    its center of population, government, tourism, and economy.
                    Global influences found in Tarawa are also visible on the outer atolls, including evidence of World
                    War II battles
                    (e.g., the Battle of Makin at Butaritari), tourism, copra production, and climate change mitigation
                    efforts.

                <p>
                    Kiribati’s most direct and tangible connections to the rest of the world are, of course, via plane
                    and boat.
                    Bonriki International Airport on the southeastern most islet in the Tarawa Atoll is where most
                    people come and go from the country.
                    The small terminal echoes the architectural style of i-Kiribati <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">maneaba</span>, traditional meeting houses
                    found in every village and neighborhood in the country.
                    Bonriki International receives regular airline flights from Fiji Airlines (tail fin shown here) and
                    Nauru Airlines, which connect residents, visitors, outreach workers,
                    and business and government leaders to other islands in the Pacific and, thereby, to the rest of the
                    planet.
                    Air Kiribati offers shorter flights to other Kiribati islands and a handful of nearby Pacific
                    nations.
                    On most days, the parking lot is empty, but at select times during a week, when a major flight
                    arrives or departs,
                    the parking lot at Bonriki fills up with cars and minivans to shuttle passengers to their
                    destination.
                    Minivans are the busses in this country, the primary form of public transportation along the roughly
                    20-mile-long island road that is the only major thruway in the country.

                    I noticed a pattern in the cars parked at the airport and throughout my travels in Tarawa:
                    most vehicles are used cars from Japan.
                    As seen here along the island road in Bairiki, an SUV’s spare tire cover advertises a company
                    offering inexpensive access to used,
                    but relatively late model Japanese cars and vans available for shipment across the world. With
                    stickers, wheel covers, and other markings,
                    this connection to the most developed of Pacific Island nations is obvious to a passerby.
                    These vehicles represent a crucial resource for the people of Kiribati.
                    Cars that most westerners would deem too high in miles or unreliable for long-distance travel are
                    just fine for the i-Kiribati running a minivan bus service or
                    the more well-to-do who can afford their own transportation, given the very limited road network on
                    these islands.
                    Such cars are a common sight in other developing Pacific countries as well and signal an important
                    reuse market for
                    the constant churn of new cars so desirable among the Japanese population.

                <p>
                    The cars and most other goods arrive in Kiribati at the main port at Betio.
                    Most of the country’s foodstuffs and nearly all of its textiles come by boat.
                    Trading companies near the port take in and distribute items throughout the country.
                    This roadside shop in Betio is one such marketplace.
                    Its rice, crackers, clothing, and flip-flops are their clearly labeled with brands from Asia,
                    Australia, and New Zealand.
                    A few products that are harvested in Kiribati - coconut/copra, pandanus, breadfruit, pigs raised
                    locally, and fish from the lagoon are also available throughout the atoll.

                    Market signage commonly includes messages indicative of the ebb and flow of goods by boat;
                    the cadence of consumerism on the island. One construction materials outlet had a chalkboard sign
                    out front that said:
                    “New Stock: Roofing Sheet, Flat Sheet, Deformed rod, Strain Wire, etc.”
                    The chalkboard at the entrance to Target Enterprises, a variety store in Betio pictured here,
                    similarly noted:
                    “New Stock: Ladies top, skirt, tight pant, ladies vest, mens vest . . . Bundle second hand clothes,
                    Plywood All Sizes, Milk Powder.”

                <p>
                    Further evidence of oceanic connection is the ubiquity and multiple uses of the shipping container.
                    The metal boxes are found everywhere on Tarawa. They are often used for long-term storage and
                    sometimes as markers of property boundaries.

                <p>
                    On Tarawa, an island with population density numbers similar to Hong Kong, the availability of
                    goods from all over the world,
                    and the consumerist tendencies that follow, inevitably lead to a lot of trash. This landfill on
                    Nanikai is intended to receive the waste.
                    It is the most recent space for mass refuse.
                    Evidence of former landfills can be seen near the airport at Bonriki and adjacent the shipping port
                    in Betio.

                    Unfortunately, much of the trash never makes it to the landfill.
                    Instead, it is found on the ground all over the most populated islets on Tarawa.
                    Plastic litters most beaches, as shown here at a beach on the lagoon side of Betio islet.
                    The abundance of refuse on Tarawa raises the question of how sustainable a modern,
                    consumerist lifestyle is on a such a limited piece of dry ground in the middle of the world’s
                    largest ocean.

                    (on the building in the rear portion of the picture) is common in Tarawa.
                    Much of the material, again, is reliant on what can be brought in on the boats.
                    The rusty metal sheets marking a parcel boundary, apparently recycled from an oil company boat or
                    shipping container,
                    further emblematize connection to the outside world.

                    Signs along Tarawa’s main island road reveal the impact of aid from several countries in the region.
                    The sign in front of this complex of prefabricated multi-family homes states: “Bairiki New Houses,
                    funded by New Zealand 3 June 2016.”
                    The ubiquitous rainwater tanks to store that most precious resource in the islands stand out.
                    This is a more formal, less traditional housing option for the i-Kiribati able to get into one of
                    the units.
                    One resident of this complex told me he chose to endure a long waiting list and a longer commute to
                    work
                    (longer by Kiribati standards . . . the island road is only around 20 miles long after all) in order
                    to have a home here.
                    Much of the aid for similar projects originates in other countries in the British Commonwealth of
                    Nations, namely Australia and New Zealand.
                    Such connections are abundant. On my flight to Tarawa, for example, I met an Australian working with
                    the
                    government of Kiribati on mitigation plans for tsunamis and other disasters.
                    I shared an airport shuttle with two New Zealanders who come to recruit seasonal i-Kiribati workers
                    for jobs in their country.
                    Such examples highlight the notion that bonds between Kiribati and its international friends are
                    more than simply that;
                    Kiribati is not simply <span style="font-style: italic;">connected</span> other countries but is, in
                    fact, reliant on their aid for basic necessities such as housing and water.

                    In Tarawa, I met another Australian, Mike Savins, with longtime connections to Kiribati.
                    Savins had a career in high-end boat building in New South Wales and started coming to Kiribati 30

                    Now he builds boats at Abatao in North Tarawa to supply his customers in Australia.
                    Savins operates several other businesses on both Abatao and Nabeina islets.
                    He prefabricates panels for use in school rehabilitations in more urban parts of Tarawa.
                    He runs an aquaculture farm on both islets (part of the Abatao operation is in the structures
                    onshore visible in this image).
                    Here he raises colorful and decorative clams, imported from Fiji and raised for the US, German, and
                    other salt-water aquarium markets around the world.
                    He also grows a unique species of sea cucumber that, when fully grown, is dried and sold as a powder
                    considered to have medicinal qualities in the Chinese market.

                    Savins and his wife also run ecolodges, one on the southern tip of Abatao (pictured here) and
                    another on Nabeina.

                    Although Kiritimati (Christmas) Island is a more popular destination for tourists to Kiribati who
                    seek beaches and sun,
                    an ecolodge in North Tarawa is another option that is not far away but stands apart from the urban
                    life and crowds on Betio and Bairiki.

                    Amalgamated Telecom Holdings, or ATH, is a Fiji-based telecom company that holds the communication
                    monopoly in Kiribati,
                    yet another tie between this and another Commonwealth nation. At the K-Mart Convenient Center in
                    Betio, the small ATH sign atop
                    the refueling canopy uniquely labels the store, but also advertises for the telecommunications
                    company.
                    Similar yellow and red banners with shop name and the ATH logo are ubiquitous throughout Tarawa,
                    including on the Target Enterprises sign pictured earlier.
                    From market stalls to trading company shops to hotels, these markers are a source of inexpensive
                    signage for dozens of businesses.

                    The strength of the Catholic faith in Kiribati is easily recognizable in the church buildings that
                    dot the Tarawa atoll,
                    like this one on Bairiki islet. Note the roofing style here that, like the airport terminal, mimics
                    the style of the traditional <span style="font-style: italic;">maneaba</span>.
                    In one Catholic church I was able to enter, the pews that a westerner would expect were absent.
                    Instead, an empty hall, not unlike the <span style="font-style: italic;">maneaba</span>, served as
                    the worship hall.
                    Such dominance of this and several other Christian faith traditions underscore a long legacy of
                    colonization and missionary work in the Pacific Islands.

                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is another common denomination in this largely
                    Christian country.
                    Several chapels (many more per capita than most similar sized American cities outside of Utah and
                    Idaho),
                    an administrative building, and the private high school pictured here in Bikenibeu are evidence of
                    the strength that other Christian faiths have in this country.
                    Similar patterns of Latter-day Saint chapel density and church sponsored schools can be found
                    throughout the Pacific, in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga.

                    A Japanese curry restaurant is nestled in a neighborhood on the Betio islet, and repre-sents a
                    longstanding interaction with that Pacific neighbor.
                    Kiribati became part of the Japanese Empire following invasions on several islands in late 1941 and
                    1942.
                    Although returned to British protection after World War II, Kiribati has maintained friendly and
                    strong economic ties to Japan up to the present,
                    including allowing some fishing rights in Kiribati waters. Furthermore, Japan has contributed its
                    share of aid to Kiribati,
                    including construction and recent re-habilitation of the Dai Nippon Causeway. This road connects the
                    islets of Bairiki,
                    the country’s administrative capital, and Betio, the atoll’s commercial core, which together
                    represent the most populated sections in the country.

                    For World War II history buffs, Kiribati has yet another distinction.
                    It was site of one of the Pacific Theater’s bloodiest battles, the Battle of Tarawa.
                    War artifacts like the bunkers, pill-boxes, and gunnery pictured here remain in plain sight on
                    Betio.
                    Taiwan Park here in the Tako-ronga Area of the islet is one of the primary tourist attractions on
                    Tarawa.
                    In fact, war tourism is one of the only reasons a typical tourist spends time in the urban parts of
                    the atoll
                    since most visitors to Kiribati seek a more idyllic “island escape.”

                    Not long after their attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese took several islands in Kiribati in late
                    1941 and early 1942.
                    Tarawa was taken just days after the attack at Hawaii. By the time the US forces laid siege to the
                    Japanese during the Battle of Tarawa on
                    November 20-24, 1943, Betio was defended by nearly 5,000 Japanese men (including many Korean
                    servant-laborers).
                    The Command Bunker pictured here was headquarters to the Japanese occupying forces.

                <p>
                    The Japanese defenses on Betio were strong.
                    Four Vickers eight-inch guns on the west and south shores of the islet were a major threat to an
                    overthrow of the Japanese,
                    but ended up not being much of a factor in Battle of Tarawa. The Americans’ strategy was to take the
                    atoll by a landing and ground assault
                    on the north shores, from the lagoon side of the atoll. Three of the four guns remain largely intact
                    today, including two in Betio’s Takoronga
                    area, and this one on the islet’s western shores at Temakin on Betio’s western coastline. A
                    destroyed and decaying fourth gun is visible in the
                    water on the right of the image. In an interesting twist of globally intertwined fates, the Japanese
                    had originally purchased the weapons from the British
                    in the early 1900s to assist them in a war with Russia, and were eventually used to defend the
                    island the Japanese took from British hands forty years later.

                <p>
                    The Battle of Tarawa was a defining moment in the push against the Japanese in the Pacific.
                    It took place largely on three beaches on Betio’s north coast, which US strategists labeled Red
                    Beach 1 (shown here), Red Beach 2, and Red Beach 3.
                    More than 1100 US Marines were killed and over 2200 injured on these shores in the five days of
                    fighting.
                    By comparison, Guadalcanal had a similar number of casualties, but over a six-month period. Nearly
                    all of the Japanese defenders were killed;
                    more than 100 Korean and a handful of Japanese survivors had been taken prisoner when the battle
                    ended on November 24.
                    Around 750 i-Kiribati died over the course of World War II. Today, life goes on at these shores.
                    Fishing boats are beached up and down this stretch and people bathe in the lagoon waters. It isn’t
                    the beach paradise that some westerners might
                    perceive all Pacific islands to be. Note the rusting barges and litter in the sand.

                    When I visited one of the generator bunkers near Red Beach 3, I witnessed just how close the War
                    still can be to everyday life in Betio
                    70 years later. After passing by a police station and an officer standing guard,
                    I watched for several minutes as an explosive ordinance team removed shells from the bunker using
                    hand trucks and push carts.
                    Note the shell sitting vertically on the hand truck at the entrance to the bunker.

                <p>
                    The ordinance was then laid on pallets for future removal. This work was occurring in an area as
                    densely populated as some Asian cities.
                    Understandably, the removal team asked me to leave. I was surprised the police officer hadn’t asked
                    me to do so sooner.
                    I was even more shocked that this was happening in plain sight, with low-tech implements,
                    and without any protective gear for the workers or a safety perimeter for the adjacent residents.
                    This bunker is surrounded by homes and businesses (one such structure is visible in the upper left
                    of the image behind the trees).
                    Indeed, history can be uncomfortably close on Tarawa.

                    A number of monuments and memorials to the war dead can be found in Tarawa.
                    This one is the New Zealand Coastwatchers Monument, located at the Betio Cemetery on the islet’s
                    south shore.
                    It is dedicated to the “memory of twenty two British subjects murdered by the Japanese at Betio on
                    the 15th of October 1942.”
                    A mix of New Zealanders, Australians, and British, the men were captured by the Japanese in various
                    locations in Kiribati and brought to Betio,
                    where they were executed. The inscription lists the names of the men and notes:
                    “Standing unarmed by their posts, they matched brutality with gallantry and met their death with
                    fortitude.”

                    The US Marines War Memorial to the Battle of Tarawa is located on the grounds of the Betio Sports

                    On one side of the granite marker is a dedication to the Marines who fought and died in the battle,
                    and on the other a message of gratitude
                    to the Navy men who supported their mission. Another plaque admonishes the people of Kiribati to
                    remember that the independence they gained
                    from Britain in 1979 “would have been difficult to achieve without the gallantry and the blood of
                    these most remarkable men of the
                    United States Marines.” Another nearby monument in a park at Red Beach 2 was dedicated by the New
                    Zealand High Commission to Kiribati in 2013
                    recognizing the sacrifice of US servicemen at Tarawa.

                    Two other war memorials commemorate Japanese and Korean losses, along with a commitment to
                    cooperation and peace.
                    The Japanese Memorial Garden (pictured here) is on Betio near Red Beach 2 and the Japanese Memorial
                    Shrine is on Buariki islet,
                    on the far northern end of Tarawa. (When I visited, the garden on Betio was closed and could only
                    be seen through the fences.)
                    Commemoration ceremonies are often held at Betio’s memorial sites, foreign dignitaries flying in to
                    recognize the events that took place here.
                    As far as I have found, no memorial exists to the i-Kiribati who suffered and died during the war.

                    Made up of low-lying atolls less than a mile wide and with average maximum elevations less than 6
                    meters above sea level,
                    the threat of sea level rise has received serious attention by climate change scholars and
                    activists,
                    both for its inundation potential and for a greater incursion of sea water into freshwater aquifers.
                    Some observers point to more damaging high and king tides as evidence of that threat.
                    Sea walls and barriers, as seen here in this image of a beach on Betio (Red Beach 2), are ways
                    islanders work to mitigate such affects.

                    The geometric lines of baby trees in Tarawa’s lagoon indicate intentional planting of mangroves
                    along the atoll’s shores
                    in the last several years, a project that also extended to four other atolls in Kiribati. In
                    addition to their carbon sequestration,
                    pollution mitigation, and wildlife habitat benefits, these growing mangroves represent another
                    climate change mitigation strategy to stave off,
                    or at least minimize the impacts of sea level rise and coastal erosion. Alt-hough the project
                    contributes to the Kiribati national
                    government’s official development and biodiversity plans and sought to involve local people in the
                    planting, it has been supported by
                    outside groups such as World Bank, the Global Environmental Facility, and the governments of
                    Australia and New Zealand.
                    Here again is an example where the ties between Kiribati and oth-er countries blurs the line between
                    simple connection and reliance.

                    While <a class="location" data-layer-id="fig1">Kiribati</a>’s president, Anote Tong made addressing
                    climate change one of his most important
                    concerns.
                    He successfully negotiated a deal in 2014 to acquire several acres surrounding <a class="location"
                        data-layer-id="naviavia">Naviavia</a>,
                    a village on the large and rocky island of Vanua Levu in Fiji.
                    This image shows the edge of <a class="location" data-layer-id="naviavia">Naviavia</a> and the
                    valley below that could potentially be used as an
                    actual place of refuge,
                    should the i-Kiribati be required to leave their home. Or, perhaps the move was a political
                    statement to bring the world’s attention
                    to the plight of Tong’s tiny country and encourage ongoing support from other countries.
                    Outreach groups in Australia have offered specialized training to i-Kiribati young people in
                    professional trades so that climate refugees
                    from this nation may have a trade when they migrate to neighboring countries. Such efforts have lead
                    to increased international attention
                    on Kiribati for its vulnerability to global climate change. Major news outlets across the globe
                    covered the purchase of Fijian village
                    and a number of other journalists have profiled Kiribati as a nation facing significant potential
                    impacts from climate change
                    (see further reading for one good example from National Public Radio).
                    According to some local residents, however, much of the global media’s attention to the threat of
                    sea level rise here is overblown.
                    They look to other points of view: that natural processes will lead to growth in coral atolls as the
                    seas rise or that God
                    will simply not allow their home-land to disappear.

                <p>
                    This exploration of the Tarawa Atoll uncovers several important themes.
                    First, past colonial influence is ever-present in Tarawa.
                    When considering the legacy and impact of colonization, we often think automatically of Europe’s
                    exploits in Africa and North and South America.
                    But, the lasting geopolitical and cultural impacts in a post-colonial world clearly extend beyond
                    these regions.
                    Many of the connections apparent in the cultural landscape in Kiribati can certainly be considered
                    as outgrowth of colonial influence
                    in earlier generations. The country’s name today is a firm testament to British colonial origins.
                    And, even after formal independence from Britain in 1979, Kiribati has remained a part of the
                    Commonwealth of Nations.
                    Such placement clearly explains the role of the New Zealand Coastwatchers in the Japanese takeo-ver
                    of these islands.
                    It also provides a historical basis for why Australia and New Zealand are key tourist markets and
                    major donors of aid and humanitarian outreach
                    to Kiribati. The Com-monwealth connection to Fiji (another former British holding) is also apparent
                    in business (e.g., the country’s telecom)
                    and climate change adaptation. The World War II landscapes in Kiribati are obvious extensions of the
                    next round of colonial power.
                    Japanese imperial exploits in the mid-20th century lead the way to the Battle of Tawara, a watershed
                    moment in the American push westward across
                    the Pacific Ocean after Pearl Harbor.
                    <br /><br />
                    Second, even in what might be one of the most isolated island nations in the world today,
                    globalization and globalism are front and center.
                    Kiribati wouldn’t survive in its modern form without aid and political ties to countries and peoples
                    throughout the world.
                    I-Kiribati also have longstanding ties to religious and cultural influences that originate outside
                    their islands.
                    They have access to a global network of the “stuff” of the rest of the world, in material goods and
                    food,
                    to say nothing of other cultural influences that spring from global connection: educa-tional
                    opportunities and medicinal technologies,
                    for example, have changed the demographic and economic patterns and prospects of the Kiribati
                    people.
                    <br /><br />
                    Future prospects for Kiribati amid global climate change illustrate a third example of how
                    intertwined this country is with the rest of the world.
                    Sea level rise may lead to a diaspora of i-Kiribati to Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji.
                    Already Kiribati has been a poster child of sorts showing the rest of the world what may happen to
                    real people in real places should such sce-narios play out
                    as some scientists expect.
                    Will entire country’s find it necessary to purchase land on higher ground in order to potentially
                    resettle their people and culture?
                    Will the voices of leaders and residents of small, low-lying atoll states continue to be a rallying
                    cry in global climate talks?
                    Will Kiribati’s situation and the attention it has received on the global stage serve as a
                    motivation to the world to reduce carbon emissions?
                    The answers to such questions may not be understood for years to come, but regardless of the
                    perspective,
                    it is not likely that future climate change issues facing atolls states like Kiribati will fade
                    away soon from the global view.
                    <br /><br />
                    Indeed, in its past, present, and future, Kiribati is illustrative of the connections that even the
                    most isolated places possess within a globalized world.
