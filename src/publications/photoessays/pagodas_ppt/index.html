                <p class="start">From December 2019 to March 2020, John Bowen was a Fulbright US Scholar in the
                    Department of
                    Geography at Yadanabon University in Mandalay, Myanmar. While in Myanmar, John taught two sections
                    of introductory human geography and one section of descriptive statistics. John invited his former
                    colleague and fellow geographer, Heike Alberts, to visit him in Myanmar. While there Heike gave
                    several guest lectures and observed other classes. Both John and Heike interacted extensively with
                    the faculty, staff, and Master’s students at Yadanabon University. In this photo essay, we recount
                    some of our experiences and impressions of teaching geography and travelling in Myanmar, the “Land
                    of the Pagodas”. We end by briefly addressing the implications of the recent military coup in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Both of us found teaching in Myanmar to be challenging but also profoundly rewarding. The classrooms
                    were often hot, crowded, and cacophonous; the electricity supply and instructional equipment were
                    unreliable; and the language barrier was formidable. Yet the students were warm and engaged, and our
                    hosts were endlessly gracious. John, who was in the country longer, learned a little bit of Myanmar,
                    including a phrase that helped to draw out our students: <span
                        class='quote'>အမှားပြုလုပ်ရမှာကိုမကြောက်ပါနဲ့။</span>, meaning
                    "do not be afraid of making mistakes". We adopted a similar attitude in undertaking our adventure in
                    Myanmar.</p>

            <section id="1" class="scene" data-scene-id="place1" title="The view from Mandalay Hill">
                <div class="figure" style="background-image:url(img/figure1.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption">1. The view from Mandalay Hill.</div>
                <p> Mandalay was the royal capital of Burma in the
                    middle of the 19th century until the British consolidated their control of the territory. Today it
                    is the second-largest city in Myanmar and remains vitally important as a Buddhist pilgrimage center.
                    In this photo from the top of Mandalay Hill, some of the city's numerous pagodas are visible in the
                    foreground while the Irrawaddy River, the lifeblood of Myanmar, lies in the distance.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="2" class="scene" data-scene-id="place2" title="Donation ceremony procession">
                <div class="figure figure_size" style="background-image:url(img/figure2.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption">2. Part of a donation ceremony procession bound for a monastery in Mandalay.</div>
                <p>Families organize ornate processions to bring children to monasteries. Buddhist boys in particular
                    are expected to serve briefly (e.g., a couple of weeks) at least once as a novice in a monastery,
                    making the donation ceremony a rite of passage. The picture above comes from a procession that also
                    featured dancers, musicians, and several elephants. Such a parade might cost the family as much as
                    several thousand US dollars. The rich rice-growing landscape that surrounds Mandalay is visible in
                    the background.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="3" class="scene" data-scene-id="place3" title="Buddhist nuns">
                <div class="figure figure_size" style="background-image:url(img/figure3.jpg);"></div>
                <div class="caption">3. A column of nuns on their morning alms round.</div>
                <p> Pink-robed Buddhist nuns are a common sight in Mandalay and much of the rest of Myanmar. Here a
                    group of nuns moves through a neighborhood on their early morning alms-round, collecting food for
                    the day. The practice of alms-giving frees monks and nuns from daily concerns and encourages
                    humility. Those who give earn merit. Monasteries and nunneries are not just prominent features of
                    the Myanmar's built environment but also its soundscapes. Loudspeakers frequently broadcast prayers
                    and sermons throughout surrounding neighborhoods, sometimes even in the middle of the night.</p>

            <section id="4" class="scene" data-scene-id="place4" title="Mandalay Palace">

                <div class="caption">4. A monk is recruited for a snapshot.</div>
                <p>A group of colorfully attired girls ask a monk to take a photo at Mandalay Palace. The palace was
                    home to the last two kings of Burma before the British toppled the monarchy in 1885. Today the
                    center of the former palace is a popular tourist destination, though some Myanmar writers (e.g.,

                <p>In contrast to the antiquity of many of the country's monasteries, universities in Myanmar are a
                    newer feature of the landscape. Yadanabon University was established in 2000 and like many other
                    higher education institutions in Myanmar it is situated on the edge of an urban area. With few
                    public transport options available, students at Yadanabon University mainly drive motorcycles to and
                    from campus (most students live in the city of Mandalay). A new 150-cc Chinese motorbike costs the
                    equivalent of less than $400.</p>

                <p>The official language of instruction at Yadanabon University is English, but many students struggle
                    with English fluency. The language barrier and enormous difference in stature between students and
                    faculty inhibited American-style classroom participation when John or Heike taught. From what we
                    observed, a lot of the teaching in Myanmar consists of people repeating after the professors or
                    reading out passages from the class booklet together. Particularly as final exams approached, the
                    campus reverberated with the sound of students in building after building loudly reading together
                    from their booklets. The photo also shows the manner in which male and female students sit in
                    different parts of a classroom. The gender segregation was again observed at communal meals, with
                    males and females sitting on opposite sides of the table, and on the staff bus where males and
                    females rarely shared a seat.</p>

                    However, if a room (whether classroom or office) had any kind of improved floor (carpet or tile),
                    shoes were left outside the room as a sign of respect, so teaching and learning then took place
                    barefoot. The GIS Lab was one such room. Shoes were also taken off when entering any kind of

                <p>The classrooms at Yadanabon University lack instructional equipment beyond a whiteboard and

                    English, John and Heike generally used PowerPoint with ample text on the screen to teach. Since the
                    department had only two projectors and screens, each class meeting required a small platoon of
                    students to carry the projector, screen, a heavy backup battery (sudden power outages were common)
                    and extension cords from the head’s office on the second floor to a classroom on the third floor.
                    Given our status as foreign visitors and teachers, the students gladly performed this service.</p>

                    collaboration is too close. For instance, in John's human geography class students were each given a
                    different country’s demographic data and asked to draw and briefly interpret the country’s
                    population pyramid, but they often copied one another’s interpretations. So, for instance, one
                    student provided the same explanation for a pyramid for Bulgaria as another student wrote for the
                    very differently shaped pyramid for the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

                    geography students to make a mental map of the country. The maps varied in quality, but one striking
                    consistency was the prominence of rivers in their depictions. </p>

                <p>
                    Teachers are revered in Myanmar; in the country's predominantly Buddhist culture,
                    teachers have a status roughly equal to one's parents and monks. Male and female teachers are
                    referred to with the title <i>“saya”</i> and <i>“saya ma”</i>, respectively, meaning teacher;
                    higher-ranked
                    faculty (e.g., full professors) have a longer title: <i>“saya kyi”</i> or <i>“saya ma kyi”</i>
                    meaning “big
                    teacher”. The reverence for teachers is expressed most powerfully during homage ceremonies when
                    students kneel before a teacher in much the same posture as before a Buddhist image in a pagoda.

            <section id="23" class="scene" data-scene-id="place0" title="Conclusion">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Much improved in Myanmar after the country turned towards democracy and greater openness in 2011, but
                    the educational system remained hobbled by significant weaknesses. Myanmar geographer Aung Than
                    (2018) recently wrote that geography teaching materials must be updated, geography as a discipline
                    must address Myanmar’s contemporary problems, foreign publications must be made available,
                    memorization must be replaced by other teaching methods, and critical thinking must be encouraged
                    (see also Eschborn and Göth 2018; Hayden and Martin 2013). The fact that we were permitted to visit
                    and teach without any restrictions at Yadanabon University was one small sign of the positive
                    changes in the country.</p>
                <p>Regrettably, Myanmar's positive trajectory in matters small and large has been severely imperiled by
                    a military coup that began on February 1, 2021. At the time of this writing, it is impossible to
                    know how the coup will unfold and what its ramifications will be for higher education in the
                    country, but the early indications are distressing. The military has arrested and used force against
                    protesters, including many students and university staff; soldiers have entered campuses across the
                    country; a university rector in Mandalay was forcibly seized; and a university student in Naypyidaw
                    was the first person reported killed by the army since the coup began (Lau 2021). Myanmar's
                    universities were already largely shut down by the COVID19 pandemic, and now the coup has led to further severe disruptions in the country’s educational system.</p>
                <p>We hope that the courage of students and faculty and that of thousands of other Myanmar people who have
                    taken to the streets, in tandem with the international condemnation of the coup and sanctions
                    against its leaders, will force a return to the path towards democracy and openness. We certainly
                    benefited from the open welcome with which we were met, and we believe our hosts benefited, too.
                    Unfortunately, in the wake of the coup, Myanmar is isolated once more as the internet has been
                    repeatedly cut-off by the authorities and most flights have been suspended. We join with those
                    who have called for end to the coup. Myanmar, the "Land of Pagodas", has long been a place linked to
                    distant peoples and places. We look forward to the resumption of the country's connections and the
                    exchanges of which we were happy to be a part.</p>
