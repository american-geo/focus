                <p class="start">Bhutan is primarily an agriculture-based country, with 58% of the population earning
                    incomes connected to the agricultural sector. Nearly all Bhutanese, including those pursuing
                    non-farm livelihoods, have ties to agriculture through distinct food cultures, local economies, and
                    eco-social networks. The agricultural sector, however, faces a complex array of challenges to which
                    farmers actively respond, including: steep terrain, inaccessibility to markets, small landholdings,
                    labor shortage, aging population, water scarcity, pests and diseases, human-wildlife conflicts,
                    competition from cheap food imports, and increasingly impacts related to climate change. Our photo
                    essay illuminates responses to these challenges at the local-scale by highlighting the practices and
                    innovations of smallholder farmers to support food security in Pemagatshel Dzongkhag (translated as
                    “district”). Pemagatshel is geographically remote and socio-economically on the margins, with
                    approximately 26.9% of the population facing high rates of poverty (BLSS, 2017). Despite the
                    indicators, this district has a rich history of agriculture and food production. Our observations
                    and field data collected during 2022-2023 confirm examples of vibrant and adaptive strategies being
                    utilized by mountain farmers. Our aim is to illustrate aspects of mountain farming systems and
                    farmers’ lives, drawing attention to the <i>Tshanglakha</i>-speaking communities located in Chimong,
                    Chongshing, and Yurung Gewogs (translated as “county”). Local farmers in this part of Bhutan are
                    experimenting with various technologies and tools, including knowledge sharing activities, in their
                    efforts to mitigate risks and enhance resilience within the agricultural sector.</p>

                    Range and crosses the rivers Mangdue Chhu and Dragme Chhu. These rivers eventually converge to form
                    the Manas River, which serves as a relatively small part of the political boundary between Bhutan
                    and India. Rivers and other water bodies (e.g., alpine lakes, glaciers, marshes, springs, and
                    streams) in Bhutan provide 70,576 cubic hectometers (hm3) of freshwater annually (Wangdi et al.,
                    2018). Bhutan uses only 1% of the total available freshwater, of which 86% is used in agriculture
                    (NEC, 2016). The abundance of water in the country has enabled hydropower projects to generate
                    revenue through the sale of electricity to neighboring India. After hydropower and tourism,
                    agriculture is the next major economic cornerstone, contributing about 14.67% to the Gross Domestic
                    Product (NSB, 2023b).</p>

                <p>Pemagatshel is more isolated than western districts of the country, in part, because of its
                    inaccessibility and lack of infrastructure. Travel to this remote district is difficult and
                    time-consuming because of the extreme mountainous terrain, narrow rough roads, and frequent road
                    blockages caused by slope failures. Roads must cut across steep slopes marked by geomorphic
                    instability, which is exacerbated by landslides, rock falls, heavy monsoon precipitation, and
                    seismicity. These factors hinder access to communities and increase travel risks. Road construction
                    and maintenance require huge investments in resources. As we can see here, work crews strive to get
                    road repairs underway in advance of the monsoon season (officially from June to September).</p>

                    Pemagatshel’s vast intact forests are comprised of mainly mixed coniferous and broadleaf species
                    that cover 87.65 % of its total land area (1,023 square km) (Pemagatshel Dzongkhag Administration,
                    2022). Forest types vary depending upon the elevational gradients and include Eastern Himalayan
                    lowland tropical forest and dry subtropical mixed forest. These forests provide vital habitat for
                    wildlife such as the Golden Langur (<i>Trachypithecus geei bhutanensis</i>) featured here, which is
                    one of
                    the most endangered primate species in South Asia. The presence of other unique species reinforces

                    hoses are used to bring water to the terraced fields and for direct application of water on fruit
                    orchards. The dearth of irrigation water affecting the agricultural sector is part of the changing

                    and blame climate change for dried up water sources and increasing water scarcity. Farms are
                    scattered and located far away from drainages and valley bottoms where irrigation water is
                    plentiful. Large volumes of water flow off mountains into deep gorges, making it inaccessible for

                    fabric, electric or wooden fencing; and green nets.</p>

                <p>Local cattle such as Himalayan breeds known as Jatsha-Jatsam, Yangku-Yangkum, Doethra-Doethram, and
                    Jaba play a vital role in these mixed smallholder farming systems. Livestock provide manure as a
                    source of fertilizer and animal traction for plowing fields. Dairy farming is a dominant activity,
                    and nearly all households have some cows. Except for a few families, most farmers have transitioned
                    out of pig, poultry and fish farming due to strong religious sentiments and a more recent ethical
                    and moral turn away from killing animals.</p>

                <p>As a mountainous area, most agricultural lands are on rugged terrain, which limits the mechanization
                    of many farm activities. Few farmers in the study area have access to or own farm machinery and
                    equipment. Only selected machinery and equipment such as power tillers, mini-tractors, mini power
                    tillers, and hand tools are used. Farmers see some mechanization that is appropriate for this unique
                    geographical terrain as having huge potential to address the labor shortage, enhance farm efficiency
                    and upscale agricultural production.</p>

                <p>Abandoned stone and mud brick houses such as this one are common. Abandoned farmhouses are known
                    locally as <i>gungtongs</i> or “empty houses.” Personal communication with local residents and the
                    agricultural field supervisor along with our resource mapping study indicate that in some villages
                    in the Yurung Gewog up to 50% of the population has moved out and relocated to larger towns in
                    distant areas, even in western Bhutan. This phenomenon has three interconnected consequences: the
                    rural labor force is reduced; community vitality and cultural heritage become difficult to maintain;
                    and people’s involvement in local food and agricultural systems are weakened. Several processes -
                    the out-migration of young people, an ageing rural population and an expanding urban population not
                    contributing to food production – are expected to further strain the future productive capacity of
                    the agriculture sector in Bhutan. In the absence of more visible and frequent human activity on the
                    land, wildlife damage to crops has been on the increase.</p>

                <p>Even in the remote eastern districts, farmers adopt a variety of digital, online and mobile phone
                    communications to support market transactions. Some farmers use SMS via mobile phones to digitally
                    market their agricultural produce and to communicate market and price updates to their networks.
                    Vegetable sales via mobile banking, pictured here, are widespread given that internet connectivity
                    is reliable even in relatively out- of-the-way valleys. Farmers also continue to rely on
                    conventional television and radio broadcasts to receive updates about agricultural markets and
                    auctions for cash crops bound for export to India.</p>

                <p>This truck is among a fleet that is delivering tree saplings to Pemagatshel and the other 19
                    districts in Bhutan as part of His Majesty’s One Million Fruit Trees Plantation Project. The first
                    phase of tree sapling distribution was initiated in March 2022. The second phase of the project in
                    Pemagatshel was launched on 21 February 2023 to coincide with the 43rd Birth Anniversary of the King
                    of Bhutan. This project is another example of resilience-minded support for mountain farmers as
                    high-value trees will help diversify not just the income sources but also enhance the nutritional
                    diversity, food security and produce available for consumers. The tree products can also be used for
                    traditional festivals and ceremonial purposes, thereby reducing the dependence on the import of
                    expensive fruits and nuts from outside of Bhutan. The thirteen varieties include nut trees (almond,
                    walnut, macadamia, pecan), fruit trees (kiwi, avocado, dragon, Irwin mango, mandarin, seedless lime,
                    soursop, coconut), and a fragrant resinous hardwood (agarwood). The trees are distributed free of
                    cost to interested farmers and are geo-tagged for management and monitoring purposes. Youth
                    volunteers (known as “DeSuups”) have been dispatched across the country to assist with the planting
                    of these tree saplings.</p>

                <p>The complex agro-ecological zones and micro-climates in Bhutan make it possible to grow diverse
                    cereals, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. These agro-ecological systems, in turn, influence vibrant
                    and nourishing food cultures, as the “Food Map of Bhutan” illustrates (Tshering and Norbu, 2020).
                    While doing fieldwork, we found the commitment and pride of local farmers to sustaining these
                    systems was visible in myriad farmer-led efforts to address context-specific challenges within the
                    agricultural sector. We learned that resilience strategies often unfold at the micro-scale, as in
                    the case of one women farmer saving previously undocumented heritage seed. Similarly, at the
                    community-scale Pemagatshel’s farmers are mobilizing an array of climate-smart technologies and
                    farming practices, thereby mobilizing memories of resilience and reinforcing collective capacities
                    and adaptation to change.</p>
