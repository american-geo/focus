                        <p class="quotation">
                            When I was around 4 years old, my parents bought a
                            water buffalo. My job was to take care of her, and I
                            loved watching how she changed with age. I would
                            take her into the fields to feed her at this area of
                            grass she liked between two wet rice paddy fields.
                            When I got lazy, I would ride her around until she
                            tried to throw me. Our buffalo was trained not to
                            eat rice (but she still did), and she could
                            understand Vietnamese words like
                            <span
                                style="font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 1px;"
                                >đi = go, bặt = turn right, and diệt = turn left </span
                            >. She was also sometimes a really naughty buffalo.
                            She hated work so whenever she saw our plough, she
                            simply ran away. Farmers know that naughty buffalo
                            are a real pain, as it is really tiring trying to
                            get the necessary work done. But you see, I think
                            there is something more. I know that buffalo
                            understand human feelings. As a child, when I was
                            upset and crying and ran away from my parents for
                            whatever reason, I always came to our buffalo for
                            support. I would pet her and tell her my story. At
                            these times, she would never be naughty, and just
                            slowly ate grass while listening to my stories. I
                            used to catch insects and cook rice soup for her
                            when she got tired. In the evenings, she would eat
                            rice straw, and my mother sometimes added salt water
                            to her meal to improve the flavor. In the field
                            (where she knew I would give her some food), she
                            would turn around like a pet dog when I approached.
                            We considered our buffalo as a member of the family.
                            There were also some emotional times. I remember how
                            our buffalo cried when we sold her baby. I also
                            remember when my mom decided it was time for her to
                            be sold. I was so sad. My mom says that animals are
                            sensitive to the smell of blood on people who work
                            in a slaughterhouse. When our buffalo smelled the
                            buyer, I swear I saw that she was crying. She knew
                            what was going to happen. After she left, whenever I
                            saw her empty stall, I always felt sad. These days,
                            when I see water buffalo in the fields, it reminds
                            me of my childhood and happy times. I think children
                            today no longer care about buffalo like in previous
                            generations. They spend too much time studying and
                            playing video games. Buffalo meat is also now more
                            popular in the market, and people are forgetting our
                            previous working and personal relationships with
                            this animal. Tractors now do the work, and buffalo
                            are simply raised in pens for profit. It really
                            saddens me.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a class="location" data-layer-id="vietnam-center">Vietnam</a> is industrializing quickly, and the north of the
                        country is no exception. On the flatter lands in the
                        comparatively wealthier farming communities around the
                        capital of Hanoi, the gasoline powered tractor has
                        largely replaced the labor of the buffalo. As the
                        population demands more meat in their diet, water
                        buffalo are now raised for consumption, often in pens,
                        rather than for power to pull ploughs. In these areas,
                        children no longer grow up with closer personal
                        relationships with these animals.

                    <p>
                        As a research team, we have considerable respect for the
                        complex social, cultural, and economic histories the
                        different people in the north of the country have with
                        water buffalos. Indeed, since 2016, we have been
                        collecting stories such as that in the introduction to
                        interpret how economic development is affecting these
                        human-animal relationships.

                        provincial capital of

                        reviewing interview transcripts one rainy December
                        afternoon in 2018, the research team realized it needed
                        a dose of positivity and a mental re-boot. It was time
                        to reconnect to the places where the buffalo are still
                        profoundly entrenched in the daily lives of the people.
                        It was time again to head to the mountainous regions
                        further north. Bac Kan Province is located in the
                        mountainous region in the north of Vietnam.
                        Approximately 87% of its 308,900 inhabitants are members
                        of an ethnic minority, including the Tày (54%), Dao
                        (17%), Nung (9%), and H’mong (5.5%) groups. In 2014, the
                        per capita income in the province was estimated at US
                        $1,120, meaning it one of the most impoverished areas in
                        the country (Department of Labour, Invalids and Social
                        Affairs, 2015).

                        We decided to focus on

                        than the dynamics present in a farmers’ market, and we
                        knew this one specializes in the sale of water buffalo.
                        We took a list of local contacts, the best cameras we
                        could find, and a DJI Phantom 4 sUAV (i.e., drone).
                        While visiting old friends, building new research
                        networks, and conducting interviews for our larger
                        project, we strove to document a day at the market.

                        December in Bac Kan Province. The rice harvest is over
                        and the usual lush bright greens have given way to more
                        somber ambers. December is in the dry season (which
                        lasts from November to April). Climate change is
                        extending the length and severity of this season which
                        is resulting in drought conditions that stress animal
                        and agricultural production. Crop failures and disease
                        outbreaks in livestock continue to hamper economic
                        development.

                        economies. Prior to its establishment, residents needed
                        to travel on unpaved roads over 40 km to purchase
                        necessities such as salt and oil. The road was improved
                        in 2004. The market schedule is organized on the lunar
                        calendar, and operates five to six times a month.

                        were unable to answer how the plant was ultimately used.
                        With the market’s proximity to the Chinese border
                        however, many locally grown products like this (and for
                        example most bananas produced in the region) are
                        exported. Pieces of the fern were later determined to be

                        The bells are manufactured in neighbouring Cao Bang
                        Province and contribute to the acoustic symphony of
                        sounds common at higher elevations in the north of
                        Vietnam. Buffalo are said to be able to recognize the
                        bell sounds of other buffalo in the group, especially
                        the more dominant alphas. Traditionally, bells were
                        handmade from bamboo. In that case, the owners also knew
                        which buffalo were theirs based on their unique sounds.
                        After seeing these different bells, the research team
                        knew it was time to trot over to the livestock market
                        next door.

                        Cao Bằng, and Vinh Phuc. Livestock easily comprise the

                        people. H’mong people are renowned as being experts in
                        the raising of livestock. This breed is well adapted to
                        local conditions. Men at the market explained that only
                        this breed of cow can thrive in the higher elevations on
                        dried grass.

                        In this part of the country, buffalo continue to be
                        favored over mechanical tractors for ploughing. Buffalo
                        are cheaper, can be fed vegetation rather than costly
                        gasoline, provide natural fertilizer, and are said to be
                        more efficient in the smaller, upland fields and wet
                        paddies. Soils regionally are also quite rocky, and
                        buffalo are known to stop before stepping on impediments
                        to warn farmers of the problem. Buffalo are also loved
                        as they recognize their names and their owners.

                        Unlike the neighbouring section of the market, the trade
                        in livestock is largely an all-male affair. Most
                        conversations are in the indigenous languages of local
                        ethnic minorities, such as the H’mong and Tày. In this
                        scene, men gather to discuss the qualities and
                        shortcomings of a buffalo.

                        Buffalo are selected by buyers based on appearance and
                        need. Things to look for include the shape of the mouth,
                        head, and hindquarters, the height of the body, the
                        muscle definition, and the horn length. Long held
                        beliefs that specific patterns manifested in the coat of
                        the buffalo will determine if it is aggressive or meek
                        are also considered. Payments are in cash.

                        This clip shows negotiations over the price of a water
                        buffalo between H’mong men. The video does not include
                        the original offer (likely around $1,100). The seller
                        (holding the rope) explains that the buffalo already
                        knows how to plough and that he will lose out if he
                        sells it at such a low price. “Perhaps you should pay
                        $10 more!” He yells. “But you can only eat a little food
                        with $10!” comes the response implying it is a paltry
                        sum to squabble over when considering the much higher
                        base price of the buffalo. “Ha, just kidding!” replies
                        the seller. A third man yells “You should pay $30 more!”
                        Generally, while the prices and bargaining are serious,
                        the tone is jovial and good-natured.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cong Bang Market in Bac Kan Province in the north of
                        Vietnam represents a crossroads of socio-cultural and
                        economic realities. Various people of different
                        ethnicities from across the region bring a diverse range
                        of prefabricated and handmade goods, traditional
                        medicines, crops, and livestock to sell locally and to
                        export further afield. This photo essay highlighted only
                        a small portion of this trade, but did identify a number
                        of themes, including the rising economic influence of
                        neighboring China.

                        It is also within this milieu that the position of the
                        water buffalo remains firmly entrenched in the daily
                        life, the thoughts, and the hearts of many in the
                        region. Although mechanical tractors have largely
                        replaced buffalo in the lowlands around Hanoi, in the
                        higher elevations of Bac Kan Province in the north of
                        the country buffalo remain favored for ploughing. Less
                        expensive and natural providers of fertilizer, they are
                        said to be more efficient under local agronomic
                        conditions. Indeed, water buffalo are still revered as
                        an integral part of local working culture and one of the
                        most important elements of economic survival. For many,
                        the trip to the market and the purchasing of a new
                        buffalo is therefore a considerable economic decision.
                        Buffalo also have their own personalities and recognize
                        their owners, endearing them to farmers. Emotional
                        connections with these animals can be made extending
                        beyond the mechanical. As such, for many in this small
                        sliver of the world, buffalo are still considered part
                        of the family.
