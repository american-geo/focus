                <p>The roadside has long been a topic of interest to geographers. Over the years multiple approaches and
                    methods have been used to understand this prominent landscape. In recent years, a wide chasm has
                    opened among traditional geographic studies of the roadside, landscape histories, and current
                    mobility studies. The former relied on slow, halting excursions that demanded the field worker pause
                    and record roadside features in great detail. Landscape histories rely on archival material and
                    field work to trace changing assemblages of features that line routeways. Mobility studies insert
                    the traveler as the primary object of observation and analyze the travel experience more than the
                    landscapes outside the vehicle. This paper reports on the use of a GoPro camera mounted inside a car
                    to capture time-lapse images of long-distance drives which blends some of the strengths of each
                    approach.

                <p>Fred Kniffen drove the roads of Louisiana in the early 1930s to identify, document, and classify folk
                    housing (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). His field work was done
                    in a car, but involved frequent stops to meticulously record the traditional structures: dogtrots,
                    Acadian cottages, and other folk dwellings. Although relying on an auto for conveyance, his pace was
                    more akin to Carl Sauer’s description of field work: “Locomotion should be slow, the slower the
                    better, and be often interrupted by leisurely halts to sit at vantage points and stop at question
                    marks” (Sauer, 1956, 400). Indeed, the cursory mention that Kniffen made about his method was: “It
                    is slow, it involves an unwieldy mass of data . . .” (Kniffen 1935, 180). He made the case that his
                    field work, although filled with challenges, would enable the mapping of culturogeographic regions
                    that were readily apparent from the roadside. In Louisiana, he argued, house types are an element of
                    culture that possessed great diagnostic value in regional differentiation. He later went on to
                    enlarge his analysis of vernacular structures to map the routes of cultural diffusion across the
                    entire eastern U.S. In his words, he ranged “through the whole eastern United States from the Gulf
                    [of Mexico] to the [Great] Lakes and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi” (Kniffen 1965, 550). His
                    focus of folk housing reflects his belief that “folkways are comparatively the simplest and most
                    direct expressions of fundamental needs and urges” (Kniffen and Glassie 1966, 41). These efforts
                    were classic windshield geography - observation from the seat of a car moving through the landscape,
                    interspersed with close inspection of specific features. The target of observation was narrowly
                    defined, and the methods were akin to a biogeography field survey - mapping distributions, charting
                    morphologies, and classifying types. </p>

                <p>Over the last few decades, landscape histories of roadsides have proliferated. John Jakle and Keith
                    Sculle have produced a library of books about roadside landscape change that directs attention to
                    the material culture alongside the road (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>; Jakle and Sculle 2002,
                    2004, 2008, 2011). And
                    there are numerous books about the more prominent highways, such as the National Road (Raitz and
                    O’Malley 2012) and England’s M1 Motorway (Merriman 2007). The Vales’ and Wyckoff’s work on repeat
                    photography provides a complementary tool for capturing insights about the changing roadside
                    landscapes (Vale and Vale 1983 and Wyckoff 2006). While these authors follow rigorous methodology,
                    copious use of landscape photographs illustrate these works, and method and theory are mentioned in
                    passing.</p>
                <p>These traditional approaches stand in contrast to a host of recent cultural geography field studies
                    which rely on thick discussions of methods and theory. In these works the role and sensations of the
                    observer becomes as important as the external landscapes (Delyser and Starrs 2001). Indeed, an
                    emerging line of inquiry framed by the conceptual approach referred to as mobility studies contain
                    remarkably few images (Edensore 2003 and 2004 and Merriman 009). Overlapping in time, if not
                    conceptual orientation, with the more traditional approaches, mobility studies demonstrate a new
                    appreciation for observation of the roadside landscape from vehicles in motion. With their emphasis
                    on the driver as an experiential traveler, they afford little concern with the landscape (Endensore
                    2003). Some authors ignore the underlying processes that create the roadside that is visible from
                    the driver’s seat and eschew photographs, while others acknowledge the importance of highway
                    construction history and the resulting infrastructure (Merriman 2007). Those practicing these newer
                    approaches declare that the observer’s presence, moving through space, in effect creates the
                    landscape. Their inquiries – which focus on the body in motion and experiencing that movement –
                    concentrate on the personal experiences of the drive. </p>
                <p>Alongside these pursuits is also a burgeoning body of scholarship that considers the use of various
                    photographic tools to record the landscape and the individual in motion (Rogoff 2000, Garrett 2010,
                    and Vannini 2017). Discussions of wearable technology merge with this experiential reporting and
                    place the field worker at the center of the scene - rather than the landscape (Chalfen 2014).
                    Time-lapse photography has been used extensively to track change from a fixed camera position
                    (Simpson 2012) and also to capture long-distance journeys (Mather 2014). Mather’s transcontinental
                    drive across the U.S. consists of an intense 1 hour and 47 minutes of driver’s seat -view of
                    interstate highways, that offers no insights into the processes behind this extensive engineering
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <p>This paper will draw some connections among the slow field work akin to the work of Sauer and
                    Kniffen, historical roadside landscape history, and the emerging work on mobility and visual
                    studies. The notion of mobility was not absent among those pursuing the traditional approaches.
                    Pierce Lewis used the term as the unifying thread in his opening chapter in the landmark volumes on
                    the National Road. He makes the case that mobility is a driving passion that has defined the whole
                    American experience, and that Americans are enraptured with the people and things that make mobility
                    possible (Lewis 1996, 3 & 7). Jakle and Sculle, the two-headed juggernauts of roadside landscape
                    scholarship, argue that geographic mobility, in the American context, promised not just geographic
                    mobility, but social mobility as well (Jakle 2010, 420). Participants driving the current mobility
                    turn see mobility in very different terms. They make the case that we experience the landscape by
                    moving through it (Ingold 1993), and that what we observe, what we experience, is influenced by
                    movement. The perspective from a body in motion becomes the core of their observations. As a
                    consequence, their methodological challenge is how to capture and present mobile experiences (Urry
                    2007 and Finchin et al. 2010, 1-2). Thus, there is a range of conceptual underpinnings to the notion
                    of mobility that, while not in complete alignment, are not necessarily contradictory.</p>
                <p> In this preliminary presentation on recent field work, I hope to critically examine what time-lapse
                    photography along Louisiana’s highways can add to our understanding of landscapes and landscape
                    change and how it can serve as a document of historical landscapes and also a record of the observer
                    in motion. Most of the traditional houses that Kniffen tallied are no longer standing along
                    Louisiana’s roads, indeed they would be largely invisible in this form of documentation. Nonetheless
                    there is an abundance of material culture features and physical landscapes that time-lapse
                    videography captures and permits subsequent examination and interpretation. The field work that
                    provided the basis for this paper represents the first foray and will be followed by subsequent
                    repeat videos that can expose change over time. Each sequence will also encapsulate a long-distance
                    drive in a compressed format that will allow others to gain at least a superficial experience of
                    traveling the particular route. Thus, I am convinced it offers a bridge among windshield geography
                    of roadways, landscape change, and mobility studies of highways.</p>

                <h3>Capturing Long-Distance Landscapes</h3>
                <p>In the spring of 2017 I began documenting the main routes of Louisiana using time-lapse photography
                    from a windshield-mounted GoPro camera (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). My work sought to use a
                    form of photography that
                    captures individual images at set intervals of time. For decades, it has been used extensively from
                    a stationary vantage point in biological and meteorological studies to track the slow growth of
                    plants or the more rapid formation of storms. It is also used with increasingly frequency, again
                    from a fixed position, to track the construction of large buildings and engineering works. Depending
                    on the interval between images, the camera can compress a two-year construction project into a
                    matter of minutes. Likewise the film maker Evan Mather has compressed a multi-day cross-country
                    drive into less than two hours (Mather 2014).</p>

                <p> I set out to record the observable landscapes along the principal non-interstate highways in
                    Louisiana. The so-called blue highways - the non-interstate, lesser-used, and often forgotten
                    highways among long-distance travelers (Moon 1982). My intent was not to retrace Kniffen’s routes,
                    but to travel the major highways and routes that were central to the state’s economic and cultural
                    development – Louisiana’s equivalents to the National Road or the Lincoln Highway. Most are numbered
                    U.S. highways that parallel railroads, but I also drove the River Road along the Mississippi River
                    which in many sections is a series of minor state highways. In all, I traversed over 5000 miles of
                    highway, in some cases filming the route in both directions.</p>
                <p>I opted for time-lapse photography to enable me to recreate extended drives in compressed time frames
                    for my classes and public audiences, but also to explore the method’s potential to capture some of
                    the experience of travel. This decision will allow audiences to accompany me across the width and
                    length of the state within modest time spans. A video of the trip would avoid the messy and choppy
                    imagery of the time-lapse, but oblige me to spend an entire semester introducing students to the
                    state’s highway landscapes or limit presentations to frustratingly short segments of the road. After
                    some experimentation, I selected a 1-image per second interval. This gives fairly complete imagery
                    at lower speeds, but also provides the sensation of viewing an uninterrupted scene at highway
                    speeds. It also captures pauses in the normal motion of the highway. And although Kniffen thought he
                    was dealing with unwieldy volumes of data, the digital files for this procedure are substantial –
                    but less than full video recordings. Using this method, I traveled the longest route in the state
                    over a three-day period and compressed the resulting video to about 20 minutes. In homage to Kniffen
                    and Sauer, there were some lingering halts at “question marks,” but they were not recorded in
                    time-lapse. I did shoot a lot of still images as well to document those pauses.</p>
                <p>The windshield placement provides the viewer with a front-seat perspective that is familiar to both
                    drivers and passengers. I directed the camera’s wide-angle lense to the road’s centerline. This
                    produces a view dominated by the paved surface itself, but it also captures the peripheral
                    landscapes on both sides of the road, along with other motorists. Filming both sides was important
                    for those routes that I only drove in one direction. The camera’s orientation is pivotal to both the
                    ability to capture images of the roadside and the experience. It also captures nearly all features
                    the car passes by. Thus, it is less selective than still photographs. Vannini and Stewart advanced
                    the term “GoPro gaze” to refer to the ability of this handy wearable camera to capture suspenseful
                    adventure. While this might be true for video productions of snowboarding or hang gliding, or even
                    dancing in at Cajun nightclubs, my long-distance drives through a state not noted for dramatic
                    scenery offered little in the way of adventure or suspense (Vannini and Stewart 2017). In fact, one
                    reviewer of this manuscript commented on the unexpected monotony of the state’s topography.
                    Nonetheless, as in adventure sports, the GoPro allows the viewer to get a sense of being a part of
                    the action and movement, to share a bit of the experience – without motion sickness. At the same
                    time, it did not fit in the category of Urry’s tourist gaze which refers to the cultural conventions
                    that shape how tourists view, appreciate, and capture landscapes (Urry & Larsen 2011). This
                    technique overcame that cultural bias. Not wanting to litter the literature with catchy terms, I
                    suggest that this method allows non-participants to get a sense of travel and inserts them in a
                    culturally familiar front-seat position. For those with more specific training it permits what I
                    refer to as a geographers’ gaze. Even as Kniffen commented in his 1935 paper, the trained geographer
                    can extract more meaning and understanding from this technique. The geographer’s gaze assumes a
                    background knowledge of historical processes underlying the construction of human roadside
                    landscapes and even those landscapes beyond the immediate frame of the camera which impinge on the
                    visible scene. It demands familiarity with the work of the likes of Jakle, Sculle, and Raitz, but
                    also enables an experiential perspective.</p>

                <p>Opting to travel the blue highways, in many respects, pre-determined the images that would be
                    captured. These routes penetrate the heart of towns and cities, and avoid the set-back, sculpted
                    landscapes along the Interstate highways (the Motorways used by Merriman). This decision was vital
                    to capturing the roadside features that crowd the shoulders of the older routes (<a
                        href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>).
                    Interstates have redirected traffic and consequently have contributed to considerable commercial
                    decline along the older routes (Norris 1987). This reorientation in traffic contributed to one of
                    the dominant overall impressions – widespread dereliction. And the commercial strips illustrate this
                    change in profound ways. But, using the time-lapse photography, one of the underlying influences for
                    public acceptance of limited access highways becomes all too apparent. The profusion of traffic
                    lights and the stop-and-go traffic through larger cities underscore the inefficiency of the
                    unlimited access roads.</p>
                <p>John Jakle offers five categories in his overview of roadside landscapes: rural, suburban, commercial
                    strip, inner city, and CBD (Jakle 2010). I turn to his typology, with some modifications for
                    organizational structure. In Louisiana, there are multiple rural landscapes, most relatively
                    monotonous, but reflective of the states physical geography or its rural economies. Three quick
                    rural vignettes will suffice here. (Viewers should not expect sound which is not recorded using the
                    time-lapse photo mode.)</p>

                <h3>Benefits and Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>These short clips reveal numerous shortcomings of this method. The road and the sky obviously
                    dominate the image, and the fixed perspective eliminates the possibility of panning to follow an
                    object of interest. Early morning sun light and the tyranny of shade obscures many features in this
                    form of documentation, and when undertaking long-distance drives, it is sometimes difficult to drive
                    only during optimal lighting. It is impossible to focus on details of the landscape and the rapid
                    pace can be a bit disorienting if not mind-numbing after extended viewings. Using time-lapse,
                    ambient sounds are not captured, although sounds can be inserted in the editing process. One loses
                    external noises and also the internal sounds of radio news stories or music that shape the driver’s
                    experiences. The actual feel of driving – vibrations, acceleration, deceleration, and turning – are
                    absent.</p>

                <p>On the positive side, it permits a simulated passage over lengthy stretches of road in a short time
                    that offers a blurred panorama of the roadside that is akin to our memories of long drives. It
                    provides a motorist’s perspective that enables viewers to discern the broad landscape textures in
                    the sequences in which they appear. And, I am experimenting with repeat time-lapse photography along
                    a major commercial strip in Baton Rouge that is undergoing a major modification. A series of monthly
                    photo excursions will enable the tracing landscape change along a 2-mile stretch of road that will
                    be akin to static repeat photography, while capturing change along an extended route.</p>

                <p>There are other benefits as well. Insertion of route maps and voice-overs can effectively introduce
                    audiences to the varied and complex roadside landscapes at a particular point in time. Shown as a
                    video, rather than static photographs, will appeal to viewers. This method is also more inclusive
                    than selective photographs. It captures all the landscapes the driver passes, not just choice
                    features. This makes it a more complete record of the landscape at the time of the filming. More
                    importantly, using videos of extended stretches of highway, the method simulates movement and
                    enables a sense of travel or mobility. Thus, it can begin to offer the sensations described in prose
                    by the mobility studies scholars. The full route videos situate the viewers in the front seat and
                    can immerse them in the visual experience of long-distance travel in relatively short spans of time.
                    In effect, this approach can build on the both the landscape history approach and enrich the
                    mobility approach with a powerful visual component currently lacking.</p>
