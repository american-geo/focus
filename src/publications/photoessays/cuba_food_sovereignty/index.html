                <p>In the early 1990s, Cuba entered the Special Period in the Time of Peace as a response to the
                    economic struggle that resulted from the loss of the U.S.S.R as a trading partner following the
                    collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 and complicated by the U.S. blockade of the country. A main
                    focus of the Cuban Government was to guarantee basic subsistence for the population. In the early
                    years of the Special Period (which lasted until 2004, when the economy returned to pre-1989 levels),
                    imports of food were reduced by half, and most agricultural inputs (e.g. petroleum, chemicals, feed
                    for livestock) plummeted by 60 to 80 percent. Cubans consumed only seventy percent of the calories
                    that they had in the prior years. The U.S.S.R had previously supplied up to seventy percent of goods
                    imported by Cuba and purchased almost seventy percent of Cuban exports. The Cuban economy had to
                    undergo a major shift to account for significant losses in trade. It turned to domestic production
                    of basic goods. Prior to the 1990s, most Cuban agriculture was large-scale, monocultural, and
                    chemical intensive, relying largely on trading partners for industrial inputs. During the Special
                    Period, Cuba underwent a large-scale conversion from conventional agriculture to smaller-scale
                    organic agriculture. Now almost thirty years since the Special Period began, many Cubans continue to
                    farm using organic and agroecological methods. Some argue that this form of agriculture can be
                    considered a component of building food sovereignty—a concept and a movement to democratize the food
                    system and in some cases protect national food self-sufficiency. The practice of food sovereignty
                    differs from place to place and here we ask: What does food sovereignty look like in Cuba? The
                    authors, as a group, arrived in Cuba with this question and embarked on an educational tour of
                    production and consumption in Cuba. Together we offer representations of what we saw when we visited
                    Cuba to better understand the practices of food sovereignty and sustainable agriculture on the

                <p>Taken inside the Museum of the Revolution, this photo showcases the grandeur and splendor of the
                    Cuban elite before the revolution. Once the presidential palace, it last housed U.S.-backed
                    authoritarian leader Fulgencio Batista. World-famous Tiffany’s of New York decorated the interior,
                    and the Salon de los Espejos was built to resemble the Palace of Versailles. No matter your opinion
                    of the Revolution and Cuba today, this palace stands as a reminder of the battles for sovereignty
                    and the pressures of neoliberal capitalism. (A. Silva)</p>

                    fertilizers and pest management techniques making it a pesticide free farm; located close to the
                    capital city, and in a neighborhood (and country no less) that has had extreme economic hardships
                    and challenges; waste being utilized efficiently and for the improvement of plants, vegetation and
                    animals; employed local residents and others in a cooperative manner in what appeared to be a fair
                    way to divide work and profits (I. Ali)</p>

                <p>This urban farm in the city of Sancti Spíritus uses a combination of organic and permaculture
                    practices. It is one of forty-six farms in the city. The land was given to the farmers in “usufruct”
                    by the Cuban government, meaning they have use of the land as long as they grow food on it.
                    Government support of urban farms and the usufruct structure illustrate Cuba’s determination to move
                    toward food self-sufficiency and food sovereignty. Sancti Spíritus is home to institutions and

                <p>The beautiful vintage cars that are so ubiquitous in Cuba remind us of more optimistic times, but
                    they are also a visual reminder of the structural violence that continues to isolate Cuba. The U.S.
                    blockade against Cuba makes trade extremely difficult from countries that trade with both the U.S.
                    and Cuba, so they are forced to make do with what they already have. The Cuban food sovereignty
                    revolution was born from dire need and isolation from global resources. After the Soviet bloc
                    dissolved in the late 1980s, it was grow food or die. (M. Mathison)</p>

                <p>Though less commonly represented than annual vegetable beds in community and family farms in Cuba,
                    mixed agroforestry systems represent an important component of food production systems, which once
                    established, can produce a diversity of nutrient dense food and other products for years to come
                    with fewer material and labor inputs than their annual crop counterparts. Additionally, they can
                    generate valuable vegetative and seed planting material for use in creating new systems throughout
                    the community. This small plot combines banana, coconut, mango, peach palm, tamarind, turmeric and

                    The farm stand is located on the sidewalk on a town street; it is small in size yet big in intention
                    and impact. The stand provides greens, herbs, turnips, and more depending on the season. This is
                    what food sovereignty looks like! Although it is not a complete food sovereignty loop, it is pretty
                    close. The community is able to benefit from the farm's ecologically grown harvests at a fair price.

                <p>Food sovereignty’s realization is only possible as part of a larger political project to imagine and
                    struggle for an alternative to capitalism. Cuba’s ongoing project to realize socialism has been
                    fraught with complications, failures, and successes. We don’t need to romanticize the revolution to
                    appreciate its foundation for Cuba’s refusal to sink into the surrounding sea of global, neoliberal
                    capitalism. Unlike many other poor states, it maintains significant control in determining and
                    shaping the direction and policies of its food system and other integral sectors like health,
                    education, housing, and more – essentials for justice and food sovereignty. (Anonymous group member)

                <p>“We must go back to the land,” Raúl Castro said when he announced a new policy allowing Cubans to
                    privately farm land owned by the government that had been sitting underutilized. This family farm is
                    located on a piece of land that was part of this program. It grows organic produce for area schools
                    and residents. The farmer told us that in Cuba, healthy organic produce is for all the people, not
                    just the elite. Food sovereignty means more than national independence. It is about local access to
                    healthy, organic food grown for the people, by the people. (M. Mathison)</p>

                    one I spoke with knew its name, but all regarded it as an indispensable foodstuff, eaten as a salad
                    and cooked green in various dishes or on its own. The plant, Talinum fruticosum, is appreciated for
                    thriving in marginal soils, self-seeding, and growing in dense patches that suppress weed
                    competition. Food plants that grow like weeds themselves, with little or no effort, can provide a
                    measure of food sovereignty to even the non-gardener or farmer. (P. Massey)</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>There are multiple understandings of food sovereignty. In the case of Cuba, the political-economic
                    context in which the government and the people seek equitable access to healthy foods is in the
                    shadow of the blockade. The food and agriculture movement(s) in Cuba is diverse and there are many
                    goals among different groups. Some groups are interested in building on the momentum behind organic
                    and low-input agriculture, using agroecological and permaculture methods. Yet Cuban agriculture
                    cannot be reduced to this one form—not all agricultural production in Cuba is small-scale and
                    organic. As an example, missing from these photos are the vast fields of sugar cane and homogenous
                    plots of tobacco. Three decades on from the start of the Special Period a variety of economic and
                    social processes are present in agricultural production, with some groups working on state-owned
                    farms, others as part of cooperatives that sell to the state, and still others that sell directly to
                    the public. There is a mix of communal and independent, state and for-profit groups selling
                    agricultural products. As a group we saw many inspiring examples of growing and sharing food that
                    demonstrate hope and love in and through times of struggle. These examples do not tell the whole
                    story, and what we saw in the fields was not always what we saw on our plates, but they do
                    demonstrate the importance of efforts to create more egalitarian systems for access to food and
                    agricultural resources. And what representations of food sovereignty we might take home with us.</p>
