                <p>
                    If you really want to feel like a dedicated world traveler at EXPO 2020 Dubai, you need a
                    passport. But this is no ordinary passport. This is a bright yellow EXPO passport that everyone
                    can buy for a mere 20 Dirham – the UAE equivalent of about US $5. In one sense, having this
                    passport makes you part of a cosmopolitan class of global citizens. It does not privilege or
                    disadvantage anyone based on where they were born or the nationality of their parents. Holding
                    this passport does not bar you from some places, or give you easy access to others. Everyone
                    with an EXPO passport is treated equally.
                </p>

                <div id="figure2" class="figure contain"
                    style="background-image:url(images/ExpoFig02.jpg), linear-gradient(180deg, black, black); height: 600px;"></div>

                <div class="caption">
                    Figure 2: Expo Passport
                </div>
                <p>
                    There is nonetheless a sort of prestige that some visitors try to get from this passport:
                    collecting stamps from the many pavilions at EXPO. Of these pavilions, the vast majority are
                    countries – 192 UN-recognized territorial states to be exact. Not long after the event began in
                    October 2021 (delayed because of Covid), a local newspaper, the Khaleej Times, celebrated the
                    Dubai-based architecture student, Mili Parmar, who set a record of getting 188 passport stamps
                    in just nine hours. In fact, she needed five passports to collect them all. When I visited the
                    Dubai EXPO in January 2022, I didn’t observe anyone going to the same lengths as Ms. Parmar, but
                    many people in my company were extremely anxious about getting their stamp, and getting it
                    quickly. True to any collecting endeavor, collecting stamps in your EXPO passport is defined by
                    a simple logic: the more, the better.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While all this may sound like a bit of fun, it is an example of how the curious spectacle that
                    is a World Expo – a top-tier World’s Fair that happens every five years – reinforces the
                    contemporary state system. The state is the building block of the dominant geopolitical
                    architecture, which organizes political space around territorial borders, citizenship, and
                    indeed, passports. Of course, there are and always have been different ways of organizing
                    political space. The territorial state just happens to be the most dominant political structure
                    today, not least because it controls our mobility through the passport system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How and why the system persists is something that has long perplexed political geographers like
                    myself. The global fetish for the state can be explained in many ways, but one explanation that
                    rarely gets sufficient attention is the fact that events organized around the territorial state
                    system, like EXPO or the Olympics, make it into something that can be enjoyed. That is, the
                    state fetish can be fun. I knew this from my earlier research on spectacle in the Arabian
                    Peninsula and elsewhere, but I found EXPO 2020 Dubai to offer a surprisingly new vantage point
                    on the spectacle of the state system.
                </p>

                <p> Sprawling over 4.38 square kilometers at the southwest edge of Dubai, the EXPO grounds include a
                    mix of dynamic and static spaces, which allowed me to witness and participate in the spectacle
                    firsthand. As I quickly learned, though, the essential building blocks of the site are not just
                    static in the sense of being solid structures, but also in a second sense – that is,
                    state-defined pavilions were the central nodes that structured space and time at EXPO.

                    Pavilions at EXPO are not all territorial states, though most are. Countries all took a
                    different approach to the exterior design of their pavilion, with some being more extravagant
                    than others. Many of the more ostentatious ones, like those of Russia, Thailand, Switzerland,
                    and Pakistan, used bright colors, shimmering facades, and ornate designs. Inside, the pavilions
                    tended to highlight the country’s national culture and scientific achievements, tourist
                    destinations, and natural features. In many cases, such as Switzerland, the pavilion exteriors
                    were far more impressive than the interiors, where there was little to see or do. In other
                    cases, there was a more elaborate set of activities, films, or displays that visitors had to go
                    through in a structured manner.

                <p>
                    Thailand’s pavilion, for example, introduced visitors to the country through a series of videos
                    in separate rooms – guided by the two mascots, pictured in front of the pavilion and on the
                    passport stamp (Fig 02 above). This video shows how Thailand was packaged and presented as a
                    modern country with a range of technological innovations and smart cities, as well as a place
                    for medical tourists. Later videos in the pavilion focused on other aspects of life that would
                    make it appealing for foreigners to visit, retire, or invest in Thailand. While I found the
                    mascots to be almost ridiculously funny, I wasn’t sure if the pavilion’s designers intended the
                    kitsch factor to be as intense as it felt to me and the European visitors in the halls with me.
                    Regardless, the idea of the films and the mascots was to present the country as a modern,
                    exciting place, and in so doing, recruit visitors (and their money) to Thailand.

                    The Saudi Arabia pavilion was also heavily geared toward recruiting tourists and investors by
                    presenting the country as hyper-modern. The ticker feed on the building’s exterior is telling –
                    scrolling text in English and Arabic included many of the touchstone ideas of contemporary green
                    modernity narratives: “sustainable cities”, “building cities of the future”, “explore new
                    wonders”, “preserving the future”, “working towards a better tomorrow”, and of course, thrown
                    into the mix, “discover Saudi.”

                <p>
                    Inside the Saudi pavilion, it was the same message: Saudi Arabia is a modern, progressive
                    country, with a rich, dynamic culture, and so many beautiful places to visit. Like many of the
                    larger pavilions, this pavilion included a rich and dynamic use of visuals, projecting images
                    and videos on different surfaces, often in a surprising and arresting manner. In one central
                    hall, for example, visitors could look down on a central dome, where birds-eye images of a
                    particular place were depicted, while behind them, rich, colorful images of that place were
                    projected next to a map of Saudi Arabia, indicating where the site was located – here, the
                    Shaybah oil field, Al-Ahsa oasis, Thee Ain ancient village, and the Holy Mosque in Mecca. Since
                    Saudi Arabia created a new tourist visa in September 2019, the country’s boosters have been
                    actively promoting tourism in the country and the EXPO pavilion was a strong investment in this
                    effort. Indeed, even beyond the confines of the EXPO site, the city of Dubai was dotted with
                    countless posters and billboards advertising the Saudi pavilion at EXPO and with it, the same
                    enjoinder: “Visit Saudi.” Altogether, the promotional campaign has a core message similar to the
                    Thailand example above: Saudi Arabia is a modern, exciting country, where visitors and their
                    money are most welcome.

                <p>
                    As the host of EXPO 2020, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had a privileged position to promote
                    its own brand of modernity and unique national attraction. The UAE pavilion was one of the most
                    architecturally daunting structures on the EXPO grounds. After an international competition, the
                    winning design by the Spanish architecture firm Santiago Calatrava blends modern aesthetics with
                    traditional references to a falcon in flight. Like the exterior, the interior of the UAE
                    pavilion was largely impressive because of its minimalism. It was not brash and loud like many
                    of the other country pavilions. It had no kitschy mascots like those at the Thailand pavilion.
                    Instead, its organizers used a more austere messaging around unity through diversity, which is a
                    core thread of Emirati civic nationalism. Besides the pavilion itself, Emirati national pride
                    was broadcast throughout the EXPO site, ranging from smaller interactive displays about Emirati
                    culture, to a placard praising the UAE’s modernity, to a series of medal plates in the ground
                    marking historic moments in the country’s history.

                <p>
                    But nationalism in the UAE has two main storylines. One is a more inclusive, civic strand that
                    embraces its foreign national residents, who comprise about 90 percent of the country’s entire
                    population. A second strand is a more exclusive ethnic Emirati identity narrative. These themes
                    of this second storyline are neatly encapsulated in the short film, which all pavilion visitors
                    had to first watch before then moving to freely explore the exhibition spaces. The film, which
                    was projected on an auditorium wall where our seats rumbled at points, captures all the major
                    tropes associated with ethnic Emirati identity: sand dunes, date palms, camels, falcons, oryxes,
                    men and women in national attire, traditional dance and music, and dhow boats and the mix of
                    desert and maritime heritage. Toward the end, the film subtly marks the 1971 establishment of
                    the UAE as a federation of seven emirates when the seven founding emirs of shown in a row,
                    before then spotlighting elements of modernization that followed, including education,
                    automobiles, and an oil plant. But per the standard national narrative, even with this
                    modernization after independence, Emiratis are shown to never leave their traditions or their
                    homeland – they remain rooted in the place and their ethnic identity.

                    While ethnic Emirati nationalism storyline was important throughout the event, the cosmopolitan
                    storyline in Emirati nationalism was the dominant one at EXPO 2020 Dubai. This was expressed in
                    many ways, but promoters stressed that the event should be the most inclusive World Expo in
                    history – defined by including the most countries possible. To that end, the Emirati government
                    paid for many countries to develop a pavilion where otherwise, they would not have had the
                    financial or political resources to participate. Syria was one such case, thanks to its
                    long-running civil war and economic dire straits. Other countries that required UAE funding and
                    diplomacy to ensure their participation included Afghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, and the Bahamas.
                    While Syria’s Economy Minister Mohammad al-Khalil took the opportunity to encourage tourists to
                    return to the country when opening the pavilion, the Emirati organizers took the opportunity to
                    showcase its tolerance and generosity by involving all countries at EXPO – international pariahs
                    included. Except, of course, for North Korea.

                <p>
                    Less an international pariah and more a regional pariah, Qatar was included at EXPO in no small
                    demonstration of the Emirati hosts’ tolerance and enthusiasm for the state system. The UAE and
                    Qatar governments were embroiled in a nasty feud that lasted from June 2017 until January 2021.
                    Spearheaded by Emirati and Saudi leaders, this involved the rupture of diplomatic ties with
                    Qatar and an air, land, and sea embargo to try to cut the country off from vital goods and
                    resources. In the end, the split was smoothed over with the Emiratis and Saudis winning
                    essentially no concessions, but personal and political tensions are still high between people
                    and politicians in all the countries. The fact that Qatar was represented at EXPO was a
                    statement in and of itself – if nothing else of a tepid regional tolerance for Qatar’s
                    sovereignty and independence from its neighbor’s efforts at exerting influence over its conduct
                    of domestic and international affairs.

                <p>
                    Inside, the Qatar pavilion was conspicuously quiet about the geopolitical crisis that had
                    defined much of its recent concerns. Rather, the Qatari approach largely followed that of their
                    Emirati rivals – preferring a quiet austerity that focused on more innocuous images, like
                    borderless maps and the requisite images of the country’s Emir and Father Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin
                    Hamad Al Thani and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa. Beyond the entryway’s simple presentation of
                    geographic facts about the country, other displays included simple videos on repeat about the
                    FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted in Qatar in fall 2022. When it comes to an uncertain
                    recovery of diplomatic relations, especially after the country’s sovereign statehood is in
                    question, it probably is safe to assume that even at EXPO, less is more.

                    Other countries with a troubled international status took a similar approach of simplicity and
                    innocuous banality in their EXPO pavilions. Turkmenistan, for example, has been firmly closed
                    off to the outside world since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Its
                    ostentatious pavilion exterior referenced Turkmen national symbols related to horses and rug
                    designs. Similarly apolitical, its interior included projected video on loop showing maps of
                    Turkmenistan as part of the Silk Road, images of beautiful and depopulated natural landscapes,
                    and at the center of the ground level room, gloriously illuminated wheat – its leading
                    agricultural product. If visitors ventured upstairs, they would encounter various aspects of the
                    personality cult that surrounds the current dictator, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. On the ground
                    floor, where I presume most visitors stopped, however, Berdymukhamedov’s cult was masked by a
                    cult of the Turkmenistan state and nationalist symbolism instead.

                    Iran’s pavilion was yet another display that involved visually-arresting exteriors and little
                    substance inside. Unlike Turkmenistan, though, one would not find any refence to the political
                    leadership in this pavilion. The preference here was to focus on culture and especially Iranian

                <p>
                    I found the Iranian pavilion to be strikingly beautiful, and it was easy to get lost in the art
                    and historical relics on display. And yet, I was also struck by the quiet foreboding of a
                    particularly martial-looking eagle with a globe, set at the entry to the pavilion. As a
                    political geographer, I understand that when I look at a statue like this, I will invariably
                    filter it through my own awareness of current events – in this case, the troubled international
                    status of Iran, the difficulties faced by ordinary citizens there, and the violence of its
                    authoritarian system. But can all this be put onto a small statue at EXPO? Who put this here and
                    why? We may want answers, but geographic images are invariably going to raise more questions
                    than to answer them.

                    relatively simple exterior, but a very rich interior. I have spent many years traveling and
                    researching in Kazakhstan, so I was not expecting to be surprised by the messages and themes on
                    display. However, I felt an urgency to go on the day that I did.

                <p>
                    In early January 2022, a wave of protests began to swell, finally crashing in explosive violence
                    and the government’s decision to shut down all internet and telecommunications network in the
                    entire country on January 5. The next day, the country was still completely cut off from the
                    world and no one knew what was happening, except that a complete revolution could be underway at
                    that moment. I visited the Kazakhstan pavilion straightaway on the morning of January 6. I
                    considered it possible that the Kazakhstan delegation may have simply closed down the pavilion
                    for the day, but it was open when I arrived. I didn’t expect to see anything changed in the
                    display – and it wasn’t. But it was different in the sense that I was filtering it through a new
                    awareness that the country was in the middle of a massive upheaval. With this in my mind, I
                    watched the pavilion’s concluding performance about the “future” with a new sheen of uncertainty
                    – for the future of the country and my many dear friends who give life to the state, willing and
                    unwilling subjects of a tragically authoritarian system. As the film waxed poetic about the
                    human relationship with technology, it was hard not to think of how these friends were at that
                    moment cut off from the outside world. And yet, it was the territorial state system that
                    facilitated this sudden technological rupture, as the government used its political and
                    institutional power to halt internet access at Kazakhstan’s borders. I acutely felt the
                    tumultuous uncertainty of this moment pulsing in the room during this performance – in the
                    visuals, the acrobat’s face, internally, and with the many Kazakhs seated near me.

                    The official Germany pavilion at EXPO 2020, “Campus Germany,” was a hulking structure. It had
                    one of the most elaborate interior sets of activities and displays – some structured and
                    unstructured, but all centering on environmental issues and sustainable living. The overall tone
                    and message of the pavilion was strongly didactic, telling visitors in no uncertain terms that
                    we all need to come together to secure a sustainable future for the planet. There were many
                    references to German industry and the country’s leadership in the field of sustainability – here
                    indexing the country’s modernity and national uniqueness like all other state-defined pavilions
                    at EXPO – though the focus was arguably more on the global, environmental story than the
                    national story.

                <p>
                    One of the federal states of Germany, Baden-Württemberg, might not have been satisfied with the
                    generic story about environmental sustainability at the Campus Germany pavilion. Or boosters in
                    Baden-Württemberg could have simply wished to go one step further by having their own pavilion.
                    Branding the state as “The Länd: the source of innovation”, the displays focused on companies
                    and business opportunities in Baden-Württemberg. Innocuous as it may seem, the fact that a
                    sub-state entity, a federal state, should have a standalone pavilion slightly disturbs the
                    organization of EXPO around UN-recognized countries. Baden-Württemberg’s representation in this
                    way would be the equivalent of Alaska or Texas having pavilions separate from the United States,
                    or the emirates of Ras al-Khaimah or Fujairah having pavilions separate from the UAE. It is
                    difficult to imagine the EXPO leadership from the USA or UAE agreeing to this, but it also
                    raises many potentially sensitive questions about separatist regions or breakaway states seeking
                    legitimacy through having their own pavilion. To be clear, Baden-Württemberg has no such
                    separatist inclinations and its organizers likely argued that they were just interested in
                    recruiting more business and tourism to their region – which is probably why its application was
                    accepted. As long as it didn’t seek to disturb the state systems norms, Baden-Württemberg could
                    stand alone and even give visitors like me a unique Baden-Württemberg Haus stamp in their EXPO
                    passports.

                    Unlike the more banal Baden-Württemberg representation question, the status of Palestine
                    represents one of the most obvious challenges to the territorial state system. Subject to the
                    settler colonization of Israel for decades, Palestine claims to be a state – as their pavilion
                    exterior makes clear in its unique label, “State of Palestine.” As we have just seen, EXPO’s
                    focus on “UN-recognized” states as the benchmark for its inclusiveness is not limited to these
                    countries. Palestine, which has non-member observer State status with the United Nations, is
                    recognized by 138 of the member countries. Its presence at EXPO was, in fact, an important
                    statement of its determination to achieve full international recognition and to realize
                    territorial sovereignty in a way that other countries of the world can. And yet, inside the
                    pavilion, the displays were largely quiet on the issue of settler colonialism. Interactive
                    displays designed around the five senses – seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, and tasting the
                    wonders of Palestine. However, upon entering into the entry foyer, visitors were directly told
                    that we were in Jerusalem, “the capital of Palestine.” And in leaving, a long descending
                    corridor took us past stunning paintings from a Palestinian artist, Lamis Abu Khalil, with
                    titles like, “Patience”, “The Pledge”, and “The Art and Sorrow of Waiting” that all spoke to the
                    suffering of living under occupation.

                    Settler colonialism was an issue that some countries’ pavilions more directly addressed. In the
                    case of Aotearoa, Māori claims to the land configured in today’s state system as “New Zealand”
                    were directly recognized. Māori knowledge and culture were incorporated throughout the interior
                    exhibit, which was focused on water. And unlike many other settler colonial states where the
                    settler language is privileged, Māori language was prioritized in the various written displays
                    of the pavilion.

                <p>
                    Australia was another pavilion that made explicit its settler colonial status. The exterior was
                    adorned with typical settler symbols of Australian nationalism, including kangaroos draped in
                    national flags, but First Nation peoples were featured prominently in the colorful entry foyer
                    paintings that depicted them joyfully standing together with other Australians. There is a much
                    more complicated story about Indigenous politics in Australia that such an image obscures, but
                    recognizing the country’s diversity was at least one way that this pavilion nodded to the
                    colonial pasts and presents that the contemporary state system is built upon.

                    Upon entering the Australia pavilion, visitors were guided through a long hall to reach a
                    circular auditorium, where we then watched a film projected on the ceiling like a planetarium.
                    The whole film was focused on First Nation Australians, who are described there as “the original
                    astronomers.” Here again, many political layers are at work in the production of this film, but
                    the fact that all visitors to the Australia pavilion were required to sit through the film in
                    its entirety ensured that the message about First Nation groups’ important place in this state
                    clearly reached us all.

                    In stark contrast to the Aotearoa/New Zealand and Australia pavilions, that of the United States
                    of America was completely silent on its settler colonial status. Primarily focused on Outer
                    Space exploration and technology – even including a real SpaceX rocket in the back – there were
                    no references to Native Americans in the pavilion. One section was dedicated to the U.S.
                    National Park Service, but true to the founding vision of the park system, Indigenous peoples
                    and their claims to the land and its resources were stripped from the story. The territorial
                    state system is built on the erasure of competing claims to sovereignty and, if the EXPO
                    pavilion offers any perspective on mainstream thinking in America today, this system continues
                    to serve the US imperial project well.

                    If the United States pavilion was silent on its settler colonial status, the United Kingdom
                    pavilion was even more silent on its colonial history. The pavilion was primarily designed
                    around an interactive exercise, inspired by the work of Steven Hawking. Visitors were asked to
                    choose a single word, which we then typed into a small digital tablet, and were then given an
                    AI-generated poem. Our words were then shown on the inside and the outside of the building, with
                    the words constantly changing and moving. The English language is, of course, a major part of
                    the colonial structures that continue to shape contemporary geopolitics. So in some sense, the
                    pavilion was a proud claiming of this linguistic dominance. But the pavilion guide told me, the
                    AI program was strict about the language choices made by visitors – refusing their entry if they
                    spelled a word incorrectly. Most frustratingly, though, she noted that the AI would only accept
                    American spellings, and not British spellings. This technological glitch was a hilarious, if
                    small, subversion of the British colonial project. Yet it did not fundamentally alter the
                    broader agenda of the pavilion, which was to shift our attention away from the past to a
                    high-tech future instead. On the exterior of the pavilion, a 2016 quote from Steven Hawking
                    speaking at the Royal Society in London made this future orientation explicit: “Remember to look
                    up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about
                    what makes the universe exist. Be curious.”

                    The Spain pavilion was more explicit about its role in colonialism, though this colonial history
                    was treated exclusively in a celebratorily fashion. Like the UK pavilion, it included a section
                    about “Spanish, an international language.” In addition to proud statistics advertising the
                    number of Spanish speakers in the world (approx. 493 million), a wooden orb paid homage to the
                    EXPO 2020 location in the center of the Arabic-speaking world by highlight the flow of Spanish
                    and Arabic words. Other sections of this display highlighted the role of Spanish explorers and
                    technology in “bridging continents” and sparking the first wave of globalization. In this
                    pavilion, Spain’s early architects of the empire and its successor, the territorial state
                    system, were no villains but heroes to be celebrated.

                    The European colonizers were not the only ones to celebrate exploration at EXPO, though.
                    Morocco’s pavilion included diverse references to the country’s rich history of valuing and
                    producing geographic knowledge, which is seldom recognized in the West. One hall, for example,
                    was dedicated to the major contributions of geographers and explorers like Ibn Battuta and
                    Muhammad Al-Idrisi. Unlike its former colonizer Spain, however, the Moroccan vision of geography
                    on display here was more about cataloging facts and producing cartographic knowledge than about
                    setting up a new political structure, which the Spanish pavilion generously labeled as
                    “globalization.” And yet, the complicated linguistic politics of colonialism silently emerges
                    here too – there are no Tamazight (Berber) translations in the pavilion displays, despite
                    growing recognition of Morocco’s Amazigh heritage in the official sphere and the amended 2011
                    Constitution recognizing Tamazight as “an official language of the State.” Like the settler
                    colonial countries discussed above, this is another example of a fundamental paradoxes of the
                    state system today: Indigenous erasures are both created by and supposedly rectified by the
                    state system. This is not a system gone wrong, I would argue, but the system working as it was
                    designed – trapping our thinking and our structuring of space in a cycle of self-perpetuation.

                <p>
                    The Oman pavilion offered yet another articulation of colonialism, albeit around a more
                    future-oriented vision of Outer Space exploration that was seen in the US pavilion. In this
                    case, though, the Omani story was focused on one of its nationalist symbols, the frankincense
                    tree. Frankincense trees were planted outside the pavilion and many rooms inside made some
                    connection to the tree, described as the “mother tree” in some sections. In a room entirely
                    dedicated to plants, a frankincense display spoke to its potential role in colonizing Mars.

                <p>
                    The frankincense display about Mars was bookended by an Arabic and an English version with the
                    same picture and text reading, “The long voyage to Mars Poses Physical & Psychological risks to
                    Future Settlers of the Red Planet. Frankincense has a known positive effect on overall mental
                    health, as well as a powerful immunity-aid due to its ability to destroy pathogens like
                    bacteria, fungi, viruses, and even cancers, which could make it a great candidate to take to
                    Mars besides other plants.” With images appropriately illustrating the idea here, we see an
                    astronaut staking a claim to Martian land, planted with frankincense trees. Traveling to and
                    settling on Mars was a common theme in many other pavilions at EXPO 2020 and indeed, colonizing
                    Mars seems to be all the rage these days. What these stories obviously obscure, of course, is
                    the inherent violence of colonization – not just to the place that is treated as a new site of
                    greedy extraction, but also in justifying the persistence of greedy extraction here on Earth.
                    And even where the territorial state system seems to be erased in the image of the borderless
                    world where the rocket ship is departing, it is not a world free from borders. I am, after all,
                    standing in the Oman pavilion, situated in a country called the United Arab Emirates, holding an
                    actual passport from the United States of America.

                <p>
                    Going back to the Belgium pavilion, where this essay started, visitors inside were reminded at
                    every turn that Belgium is “moving ahead” and that it is focused on exciting new developments
                    for 2050 or, more generally, the “future.” Future narratives are seductive because they help
                    pull our attention away from unsavory realities of the past and of today – whether those are
                    political, environmental, or today, invariably a combination of the two. It is easy to lose
                    sight of the political structures that simultaneously define these problems and set the
                    parameters for their resolution. The territorial state continues to be the hegemonic system
                    structuring global politics, so it is important to reflect on how and why it persists, as well
                    as what kind of perspectives and claims to sovereignty it erases. The spectacle of EXPO is just
                    one place where the state fetish gets turned into something fun and enjoyable, but it is not the
                    only one. EXPO 2020 Dubai is a vivid illustration of the need to look to realms of pleasure and
                    wonder to understand the persistence of the state system – and its silences and violences.
