                        Wales, with a population of over three million on
                        England’s western border, adds a rich Celtic block to
                        the broader British state. As England's first colony,
                        its economy, language, and broader socio-political
                        society have long been entwined with the British Empire
                        and the United Kingdom. The Welsh language sharply
                        declined following colonization and industrialization
                        which in the 18th and 19th centuries drew considerable
                        migrant labor to mine, mill, quarry, and ship the raw
                        materials that drove the Empire’s growth. Today, less
                        than 20 percent of the population can speak Welsh, and
                        20th century deindustrialization has left some of the
                        United Kingdom’s poorest counties in Wales.

                        These photographs, taken over the course of two years of
                        fieldwork, capture a contemporary Welsh narrative much
                        more diverse and divided than is stereotyped or
                        institutionalized. National institutions like National
                        Museum Wales or the National Eisteddfod, an annual
                        festival, have historically pushed a standard narrative
                        of Wales and what it means to be Welsh, but they operate
                        within the legacies of colonialism, neoliberalism, and
                        gentrification. Accordingly, they must find ways to
                        balance Wales’ diversity. This also plays out in
                        Cardiff, the capital city, where a new urban and
                        economic geography, organized by the Cardiff Bay
                        Development Corporation, creates new landscapes that
                        obscure the city’s economic history and drive further
                        social divides.

                        Many people mistake National Museum Cardiff for “The
                        National Museum of Wales.” At one time that would have
                        been correct, but today, National Museum Wales includes
                        seven museums, supports other heritage institutions in
                        Wales, such as the Eisteddfod, and reaches beyond the
                        walls to showcase events, performances, and other spaces
                        to tell the many stories of Wales. This photograph taken
                        during the 2017 National Eisteddfod in Y Lle Hanes [The
                        History Place] (

                        ) demonstrates through eight stools the reach of the
                        museum into other Welsh heritage institutions and the
                        collective pluralistic narrative of National Museum
                        Wales – seven equal parts of one greater whole.

                        These mosaics near the national Principality Stadium in
                        Cardiff depict many of the stereotypical forms of Welsh
                        identity: rugby, sheep, harps, castles, leeks, the
                        Nonconformist church, mining, and choral singing.

                        The Welsh nation or language did not exist when the
                        Romans invaded in the early 1st century, a point
                        regularly made at the National Roman Legion Museum. Yet,
                        the influence of Roman culture and society on the
                        chiefdoms which would eventually form Wales, the Welsh
                        language, and broader Celtic identity is clear. Here at
                        the National Roman Legion Museum a wooden tablet with
                        the oldest handwriting in Wales is in Latin not Welsh.
                        Roman and Celtic culture continue to mix in the
                        institutions and landscapes of Wales.

                        Tour guides and museum staff regularly help visitors
                        navigate the museums’ narratives. In full Roman
                        legionary dress, a staff member assists this young
                        visitor with archery. Other events at the National Roman
                        Legion Museum contextualize Roman cooking, medicine, and
                        slavery with contemporary concerns of food, healthcare,
                        slavery, and and labor. Likewise, the majority of staff
                        members at the National Coal Museum are former miners,
                        and the museums’ slate-splitters and weavers also bring
                        their personal industrial experiences to the National
                        Slate and Wool Museums. Visitors find these roles bring
                        history to life.

                        At the center of Cardiff, the National Museum Cardiff
                        houses the nation’s major art and natural science
                        collections. Although one of the most visited tourist
                        attractions in Wales, it struggles to operate at full
                        capacity and regularly closed wings of the museum due to
                        insufficient funds during my time there. In 2017, the
                        museum, in partnership with the Welsh Government’s
                        tourism office, Visit Wales, launched a system-wide
                        effort aimed to attract visitors to the paid exhibition,
                        Dinosaur Babies to offset decreased government support.

                        The split personality of Welsh identity comes through in
                        National Museum Cardiff. On the ground floor fossil
                        specimens, animals, and rocks found throughout Wales
                        display a Welsh science, but there are also many
                        scientific artifacts deemed important for the people of
                        Wales. Likewise, the first floor’s art includes art
                        painted by Welsh artists, art depicting Welsh
                        landscapes, art purchased and donated by Welsh citizens,
                        and art purchased by the museum for the people of Wales
                        to experience. A controversy has waged since the 1970s
                        about which of these collections are truly Welsh and
                        belong in National Museum Cardiff.

                        the Welsh flag, the castle nonetheless still operates
                        within the English introduced capitalist system. Its

                        While national attention and discourse may have shifted
                        over the past twenty years toward Cardiff Bay, the
                        historic center of the city and nation remains north of
                        the City Centre. The epicenter of the old Welsh Mall, as
                        I describe it, is Alexandra Gardens. The Gardens house
                        many of the Welsh national monuments. From this angle
                        you see the impressive Wales National War Memorial
                        furthest back with the black and white plinth and stone
                        from the 1982 Falklands Conflict in front. The
                        foreground of this photo, however, shows the shadowed
                        and (deliberately) worn memorial to the Welsh who fought
                        in the Spanish Civil War. While many of the other
                        memorials in Alexandra Gardens are to Welsh involvement
                        in British actions, this memorial engages with a more
                        independent, and in this case, socialist Welsh campaign.

                        economic wealth and job opportunity the economic
                        activities they depict provided. Here, Cadw, the Welsh
                        historic preservation branch of the Welsh Government,
                        maintains the Blaenavon Ironworks. This industrial
                        heritage, coupled with the Big Pit National Coal Museum,
                        provides only a handful of jobs. Despite its designation
                        as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, the town of
                        Blaenavon has seen very little economic prosperity.

                        As a part of the UNESCO Blaenavon Industrial Landscapes,
                        Big Pit and the surrounding area speak to the role Wales
                        played in the global economy and international labor
                        movements. However, these global connections fall short
                        of engaging with imperial narratives associated with
                        these industrial developments, such as fueling the
                        British Empire. Likewise, the wealth generated from
                        slavery which supported the slate industry in North
                        Wales remains obfuscated within the Welsh heritage
                        narratives.

                        From the 16th century to the 18th, English influence and
                        markets made sheep raising and wool production among
                        Wales’ most important economic activities. Sheep
                        breeding reached its zenith in the pre-industrial Celtic
                        fringe. Some of the best-known “native” Welsh sheep
                        arrived as part of Irish, Viking, and Roman influence,
                        occupation, and trade. The National Wool Museum states
                        that landscape and industry were in harmony. However,
                        the impact of the dye and other runoff from the mills,
                        as well as all the water diverted into mill races,
                        certainly affected the environment of Wales.

                        the National Waterfront Museum during the 2017 Swansea
                        Dance Days in a weekend of performances on climate
                        change and environmental destruction around the city.
                        These events complement the museum’s Energy and
                        Landscape galleries. Despite Wales’ long history of
                        industrialization and environmental impact, from my
                        visitor survey data, these two galleries were the least
                        engaging in terms of Welsh history. Events like Dance
                        Days and Roman reenactments can cut through the
                        traditional narratives of the national museums.

                        The National Eisteddfod, literally the “sitting of the
                        bards,” is an annual festival that travels between North
                        and South Wales showcasing the best of Wales through the
                        Welsh language. Poetry, music, literary, and other
                        competitions accompany other traditions and contemporary
                        concerts for ten days every August. It interweaves all
                        the contradictory and complementary influences of Welsh
                        heritage and landscape. This photo is from the main
                        pavilion at the 2017 National Eisteddfod, held within a
                        pay-to-enter walled field on an island off the coast of
                        Wales. The 2018 festival, held freely and intermixed
                        amid the urban landscape of Cardiff Bay, could not have
                        been more different. Yet many of the internal landscapes
                        of the festival did remain the same. There was still a
                        history place, an art place, pavilions for literature
                        and poetry, stages for major acts, ongoing social and
                        political lectures, and the All-Welsh Rule kept the
                        language at the forefront.

                        The National Eisteddfod holds an All Welsh Rule, which
                        requires all official events at the festival to be
                        conducted in Welsh. Thus, the 10-day event has come to
                        be known as a bubble of Welshness that annually
                        recharges the Welsh speaking. Despite being held in the
                        English-dominated capital, the 2018 Eisteddfod actually
                        had more Welsh speakers than the more isolated 2017 one
                        because of its easy and open access. This monolingual
                        sign in Cardiff Bay, nonetheless shows the prevalence of
                        English, the difficulty of maintaining Welsh, and the
                        cultural response to that monolingualism.

                        Cardiff Bay’s built environment highlights the capital
                        and the nation’s past. In the foreground, remnants of
                        the Cardiff Docks indicate one of the primary uses of
                        the area. The bright red brick pierhead building at the
                        center of the photograph symbolizes the wealth generated
                        by the coal industry in Wales. Just right of the
                        pierhead is the Senedd, or Welsh Parliament, created in
                        response to the 1997 General Referendum that approved
                        devolution from the UK’s Parliament and the creation of
                        a new Welsh National Assembly.

                        The Welsh Senedd symbolizes the most significant shift
                        in Cardiff over the past century. Previously centered in
                        the aptly named Civic Centre, Welsh national
                        consciousness has shifted to the newly developed Cardiff
                        Bay. The area now houses many government buildings and
                        other projects of the Cardiff Bay Development
                        Corporation, which significantly shaped the urban
                        landscape of Cardiff south of the City Centre post-1980.
                        These developments sit on the footprint of Butetown,
                        once Cardiff’s docklands and coal exporting center. It
                        has been a community of European, Asian, Middle Eastern,
                        African, and American immigrants, and remains a center
                        of Somali and Yemeni refugees. The governmental,
                        tourist, and retail-focused bayfront stands in stark
                        contrast to the core Butetown community to its north.

                        This Butetown mosaic contrasts strikingly with the
                        earlier traditional mosaic. This draws on the
                        multicultural history of Wales, Cardiff, and the
                        economic development of the coal and shipping industry.
                        There are specific examples incorporating transnational
                        symbols like the red, yellow, and green dress
                        symbolizing the wider Pan-African and Rastafarian
                        movements which both saw prominence in the docklands of
                        Cardiff and throughout Wales.

                        Fy Nhadau” [Land of My Fathers], in blue also invokes
                        the rich poetic and historic traditions of Somalia,
                        Yemen, Ethiopia, and Iraq. The mural complemented its
                        sponsor’s (National Theatre Wales) production connecting
                        the colonial histories of Wales and the Middle Eastern
                        world. An anti-colonial Welsh chant transcends national
                        bounds in this mural, where the “hostile array” of the
                        British Empire can be understood beyond Welsh
                        colonization to include the British involvement in
                        Somaliland, Yemen, and Iraq, as well.

                        took place inside. The first statue of an individual

                        In another two of the Waterfront Museum’s galleries,
                        Paul Robeson, the famous American artist, activist,
                        athlete, and scholar, holds a prominent seat among
                        “Welsh Achievers.” Here in the Communities Gallery,
                        Robeson speaks via telephone in 1957 at the South Wales
                        Miners Eisteddfod in Porthcawl. Because the U.S. State
                        Department illegally seized his passport, Robeson could
                        not travel for eight years, yet his ideologies of
                        socialism, anti-colonialism, and human rights resonated
                        with certain populations in Wales.

                        This connection between Paul Robeson and Wales
                        continues, and at the 2018 National Eisteddfod, the
                        first two opening concerts were a commissioned musical
                        in tribute to Robeson called Hwn yw fy Mrawd [This is my
                        Brother]. These connections signal an expanded effort on
                        the part of the Welsh Government and Welsh national
                        institutions to recognize both the multicultural
                        influences within Welsh heritage and the multinational
                        nature of Wales itself. Coordinated with the 2018
                        musical was the parade and film Carnifal y Môr honoring
                        the heritage and continuing legacy of Eastern European,
                        African, Middle Eastern, Caribbean and African American
                        influence on the Welsh nation, particularly in the
                        community of Butetown in Cardiff.

                        While the development of the Cardiff Bay continues to
                        economically and physically dislocate and exploit people
                        living in Butetown, it also creates spaces of
                        memorialization. This statue of Ivor Novello, the famous
                        gay Welsh playwright, looks back on the Wales Millennium
                        Center and the ongoing 2018 Welsh National Eisteddfod.
                        Only a few weeks later, Pride Cymru took over the City
                        Centre, and during this Eisteddfod one prominent theme
                        was Mas ar y Maes [out on the site]. These are clear
                        indicators of an emerging inclusive discourse in the
                        memory work and landscape of Welsh national
                        institutions.

                        The importance of landscape throughout and surrounding
                        the national institutions, as well as in the whole of
                        Wales reflects an understanding of cynefin (a
                        combination of landscape, haunt, and habitat). Cynefin
                        roots an individual to the land. I experienced my own
                        cynefin by tracing my ancestry back to the Vaughans of
                        Tretower in addition to my overall field experiences.
                        This cynefin also works in the opposite direction. There
                        were plenty of interviewees attached to their cynefin,
                        yet unable to access broader discourses of Welshness
                        because their gender or ethnicity barred them from those
                        typical narratives.

                        The last twenty years has seen an increasingly
                        independent and powerful Cardiff-led Welsh government.
                        This photo, taken during the 2018 National Eisteddfod
                        just feet from the art installation, “The Heart of
                        Wales,” in the center of the Senedd’s debate chamber
                        further embodies the inescapable involvement of my own
                        biases and character into the research. Particularly
                        attempting to understand nation and identity as an
                        American presents barriers of language, trust, and local
                        knowledge that even months in the field and years of
                        preparation cannot reverse. I do not pretend to be
                        separate from my research as my own narratives shape my
                        perception of memory, but I do strive to bring this
                        research back to Wales in meaningful ways.

                        This photo essay demonstrates the ongoing challenge to
                        Welsh memory and heritage of balancing traditional
                        understandings of Welshness with an inclusive form of
                        memory that includes legacies of colonialism, economic
                        development, and minority voices in society. Welsh
                        memory and national identity, even through national
                        institutions, is a pluralistic discourse. Overlapping
                        heritage themes permeate Wales from the
                        conceptualization of being the first industrial nation
                        to the significance of immigrants in national
                        development to the porous situation of the Welsh
                        language and urban development. In general, I found a
                        subtle shift towards a more inclusive understanding of
                        Welsh and a Welsh past through the national heritage
                        institutions. Through this inclusion, what results is a
                        multidimensional landscape of a multinational Wales.
