            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>College football is a United States phenomenon that occurs every autumn. Much of the attention given to the sport is usually directed towards the competitive game itself. Entire media apparatuses exist to predict and retrospectively analyze the outcomes of college football games. However, this is to serve fanbases across the country that invest in following their football team throughout the course of a season. Popular support for college football teams is visible in American culture through inscriptions in the landscape, consumptive economic activities, and altered mobility dynamics in host cities and towns on gamedays. A heightened affinity exists for the following of college football in the southern United States, and football contributes greatly to the cultural geography of many areas in the US South (Morgan & Klimasewski 2015). For many regional residents, their support for their favorite college football team, especially those members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), helps them to define and construct a place identity. <br>
            The academic study of sport within and outside the discipline of geography has traditionally focused on player production origins and the marketing and management of mega sports events (Wise & Kohe 2020, see Rooney 1969, Hetherington 1993, Lee et al. 2011, Menaker & Chaney 2014). However, there is a need to further examine vernacular, grassroots sports fandom and the ways in which support of sports teams impacts landscapes, identities, lifestyles, the environment, and human dynamics. While focusing on more popular actors like players, coaches, or managerial staff within various sports apparatuses is useful for garnering a greater understanding of competitive and recreational cultures and geographies, everyday fans deserve attention for the roles they play in the economic and cultural development of sport and tourism within society. This is especially true in 2020, a year in which the COVID-19 pandemic has immensely changed the way in which teams’ supporters perform their fandom (Majumdar & Naha 2020). Particularly, it has impeded fans’ ability to attend these games in-person, resulting in a loss of a cherished ritual for many (Cooper & Alderman 2020). <br>
            A widespread tool of fandom available to many of these common fans is social media. Fandoms and fanbases are constructed as imagined communities that support themselves by continued affirmation and recreation (Anderson 2016, Hills 2002).  Social media and its platforms have proven to be a useful apparatus for fanbases seeking to do this because it instantly connects groups with common interests across any distance to show a collective simultaneous attention to an event or matter (Dillette et al. 2019). These platforms have proven to be a powerful social force in the United States for not only revolutionizing the construction of sports fandom and fan communities; it is also changing the very places in which the sport is played. Because of the power of SEC football fandom in the U.S. South, member schools’ coaches and players are afforded a celebrity social status. Using this status and the social media platform Twitter, Mississippi State running back Kylin Hill <a href="https://twitter.com/H_Kylin/status/1275128689638936581" target="_blank">advocated</a>  for the changing of the state’s flag amid the United States’ period of intense racial reckoning in 2020.  After decades of advocacy for the replacement of this emblem which bared the racist yet controversial southern Confederate battle flag (Webster & Leib 2016, Brasher 2019), Hill’s one tweet led to immediate action by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/1e1d9c2726493917790a122b3e539355" target="_blank">SEC</a> and National Collegiate Athletic Association <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bc2347ed8a69f52bc7b060b30661808c" target="_blank">(NCAA)</a> that pushed the State of Mississippi to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/politics/mississippi-confederate-flag-vote/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twcnnbrk&utm_term=image&utm_content=2020-06-27T20%3A14%3A46" target="_blank">formally change </a> its flag. Through both the creation of fan communities and the very making of place, social media is a social force. <br>
                Social media platforms like Twitter are also useful in conducting geographic research because the media itself is generated in spaces and places that give insight into how, where, and when people (re)create places (Poorthuis et al. 2016, Metzger et al. 2016, Arthur & Williams 2019). Game days are particularly good times to study these fan cultures because of fans’ observance of pregame and game-time rituals. Rituals should not be misconstrued as banal, mundane activities; rather, ritual can give meaningful insight into societies, cultures, and communities (Turner 1969, Geertz 1972).<br>
                This project therefore uses Twitter to examine the dynamics of college football fandom in the pre-COVID era on game days in the US South in relation to fans’ place identity and construction of a community of fandom. Only tweets from public accounts were used. To search for relevant tweets, “vaguely purposive” (Reed 1976, 926) keywords like “game day” and “tailgate” were used in conjunction with official and unofficial team hashtags (Notes 1 & 2). Hashtags succinctly group tweets and their text, pictures, or videos to a single topic on Twitter, and these hashtags can be used to foster virtual community construction (Dillette et al. 2019). This essay employs a twist on volunteer employed photography, a research method that is valuable in studying sport and its actors’ relationship to place and space (Hinch & Kono 2018). These photos were volunteered on public accounts into the public domain of Twitter. Social media photos are particularly useful in photography analyses because text usually accompanies the pictures that can complement, explain, and in some ways complicate the image or the user’s intent in posting it. <br>
                This essay is focused on bottom-up fandom, so while most of the pictures returned by the query that was used to search Twitter (Notes) were generated by the official football accounts of the SEC schools, only photos posted by other non-affiliated users were employed here. Additionally, when a Twitter account was a personal one (neither a fan nor a verified account), no ancillary information about the user was gleaned or used. If the user was verified as a public figure, further exploration of their profiles occasionally contributed to the discussion. <br>
                
                Considering the power of the internet and social media to allow users to express both fandom and place-based identity, this piece works to investigate and contextualize the various ways in which Twitter users express Southeastern Conference football fandom through photos. The analysis will seek to qualitatively explore different ways in which imagined communities and places within the US South are constructed and created through experiences of college football fandom.

              <p>1.SEC football fandom is not reserved exclusively for the fall. After the triumphs or defeats of the previous autumn, fans often follow their teams during the off-season through recruiting in the spring and practice in the summer in anticipation of the next upcoming season. Noted sports geographer John Bale includes anticipation as a vital part of the sports spectator’s experience (2003, 120). Football is one of the shorter seasons in college sports, and if the sport is an important component of one’s collective regional identity, that fan will attempt to stay connected to the sport outside of the autumn season. A considerable number of hours on ESPN’s SEC television network is devoted to covering the 14 teams’ off-season activities because there is a market for this coverage due to this anticipation. Social media serves as a year-round platform where fans can continually engage with their collective support. This fan’s tweet shows an empty Ben Hill Griffin Stadium with a countdown until gameday. There is a potential energy communicated in this visual: the stadium is not yet full of its thousands of fans, the field is not yet primed and painted for the action, and the athletes are nowhere to be seen. And yet, there is an excitement and longing for the eventual time when the pageantry of gameday is realized and the ritual is rejuvenated.

            <p>2.After anticipating the journey, the next steps in Bale’s (2003) spectator’s experience sequentially include the journey to spectate and then the on-site stadium experience itself. In theorizing specifically the spectator experience of American college football, it would be useful to add another step in between the journey and the game: tailgating. Fans of the SEC tend to take their tailgating very seriously. <i>Southern Living,</i> a magazine that serves as a guide for how a perceived “good Southerner” lives in the exceptional South (Lauder 2012), has published two editions of the SEC tailgating cookbook to capitalize upon the fact that this particular ritual is a vital part of gameday for many ticket holders. This tweet from 2007 was sent at 9:15 AM showing off a fully set-up tailgating scene in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The sender contently declares his/er place to be superior to all others because of the food, event, and stadium view. Cooking food is a very common component of tailgating, and this fan is showing that s/he is so committed that they began cooking early in the morning for what was that day a 7:00 PM game. In the background is Tiger Stadium where the tailgater’s LSU team would play later that day. Again, we see the stadium as a significant icon for fans as they express their fandom. Participation in the tailgating ritual on a gameday in proximity to this cathedral creates for this tweeter the ideal place and experience.</p>

   <p>3.	The University of Mississippi’s tradition of tailgating is to convert the campus’s central quad known as “The Grove” into a pregame festival. This tweet’s photo is not focused on any one tailgate but rather on the vast nature of all the tailgates together. The Grove is known for both the sheer mass of people who congregate there on gamedays and for its excessively posh tailgating atmosphere where people are known to use crystal drinking glasses and fine tablecloths under their tents. <br>
                A component of these formalities at Ole Miss is that many tailgaters will dress formally for the day. These essentially Southern standards are reflected and reestablished by media (like <i>Southern Living</i>) and stores (like Belk, an official corporate sponsor of the Southeastern Conference, whose most recent tagline is “Modern. Southern. Style.”). This expectation of elegance is reflected by this fan account’s tweet declaring The Grove as a collective fan community to be the “#MostBeautifulPeopleAlive.” Like marketing and other media, social media works as a force to (re)create social standards (see Haenschen 2016, Stephens & Poorthuis 2015). In order to claim membership in the Ole Miss community, to truly be excited for a football game in Oxford, and to be a respectable spectator, a Rebel fan must achieve a status of beauty. Notice also the racial makeup of this collective fan community: the majority of the visible faces in this picture appear white. This racial construction of beauty and ideal fandom then establishes whiteness as a part of the elegant pageantry vital to the identity of Ole Miss football fandom. </p>

4.	While the elegance is emphasized at Ole Miss, other SEC schools’ fans also use gameday as an event for which to spiff up and look their best. This tweet from LSU focuses on presumably undergraduate fans preparing for the game, and all are dressed formally. This photo, unlike the previous ones, is less concerned with the landscape of tailgating than the people who construct and participate in the experience. For this tweeter, the important aspect of gameday is not necessarily the competition, the food, the clothes, or the tradition (though some or all of those are certainly connoted); rather, it is the friendship, community, and relationships engendered in the midst of the ritual that matter. <br>
For college students, home gamedays often serve as respites from schoolwork. Notice the cup that is partially visible in the right of the frame. The red solo cup is a US cultural icon for parties and tailgates, and it is frequently referenced in works of popular culture like 
    <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKZqGJONH68" target="_blank">Toby Keith’s 2011 song, “Red Solo Cup.” </a> 
    Research finds that alcohol consumption increases on college football game days at the home campus (Menaker & Chaney 2014). Though a majority of undergraduates are under the legal drinking age in the United States (21), alcohol, often found in disposable plastic cups like this one, is usually included in students’ weekend tailgates with friends. This tweeter is expressing her fandom by emphasizing friendship and more subtly including alcohol.

                 <p>5. In researching the American college town, geographer Blake Gumprecht (2008) found that Greek life dominates formal aspects of student life on college campuses. This is apparent at SEC tailgates and football games. Fraternity and sorority members often congregate with other members of their organization to participate in the many gameday activities. Unlike their peers’ more informal friendly gatherings, Greeks usually brand themselves not only with their team’s logo but with their organization’s letters as well. This display of community membership is a point of pride, distinctiveness, exclusivity and honor for members. <br>
In this tweet, a new sister of Chi Omega at Mississippi State emphasizes her sorority’s button as a focal point of her gameday experience. The tweeter is her father who is also proudly wearing Chi-O letters on his shirt along with the Mississippi State logo. Tradition is a popularly lauded ideal in the Southern gameday rituals, and both Greek organizations and familial ties are a part of that tradition. The commonly used saying of “Faith, Family, Football” is meant to indicate the traditions of these rituals. This father is evoking the family and football tradition by sharing with the world his observance of the ritual with his daughter. He also emphasizes his daughter’s acceptance into a new family: a sorority. Greek organizations often use familial diction in defining members’ roles. And, if an inductee’s blood relative was also once a sorority or fraternity member, they can sometimes even inherit membership into that Greek organization. This father is clearly pleased with both his daughter’s observance of the tailgating tradition of gameday with him and the infusion of sorority membership into the ritual.

       6. This next tweet is also evocative of the tradition of tailgating with family: the tweeter expresses his pleasure at his reunion with his cousin at the 2018 Florida vs Georgia game. This annual matchup played on a neutral site in Jacksonville, FL is colloquially known as the “World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party,” and it is certainly possible the cup-holding Gators fans are participating in this tradition. The tweeter shared this image perhaps not just for the family connection but also for the eccentric, colorful Florida getup his cousin was donning. This speaks to an extremely common occurrence at a college football gameday: the material commodification of fandom. Sports merchandise purchasing and displaying reflects the consumer’s values and serves to emphasize his/her fandom (Lee et al. 2011). The tweeter’s cousin paid money for each item in his extensive blue-and-orange outfit so he could then display his fandom. This tweet was probably sent in part because this outfit expresses “more” fandom than the average tailgater’s does. However, the merchandise consumerism culture is not reserved for exceptional displays of fan values like this suit; also visible in this picture are Gator branded bins, cornhole boards, a chair, a tent, and even a grill. Entire economic enterprises are predicated on the popular positive correlation between merchandise consumerism and fandom, and this is reflected across cultural and gameday landscapes. <br>
                It is also worth noting that this tweeter tagged @YallLifestyle in this tweet. Further examination of that account’s website reveals that the tweeter is actually the co-founder of the company, Y’all Lifestyle. The online store markets its products by appealing to an essentially Southern way of life. The  <a href=" https://www.yalllifestyle.com/lifestyle/" target="_blank"> website </a> explains that the “y’all lifestyle” is about: </p>
            
<i>Living in the South. It’s tailgating on SEC campuses in the fall, where you start the morning with a Bloody Mary and “How are y’all?”, followed by the roar of a packed stadium, and then meeting up again with family and friends to celebrate the win or critique the loss – but either way, there’s never a shortage of cold beverages, good buddies or laughter close by.
Football fandom via tailgating and game-going is integrated into a vision of a Southern lifestyle that is itself a marketing strategy: those who ascribe to this vision of southern living are being encouraged to purchase from this company that shares the ideal.

           7. This tweet reemphasizes the integration of tradition and tailgating. It refers to the Mississippi State custom of opening up its most coveted tailgating spot, The Junction, in an Oklahoma land rush-esque fashion where fans sprint to claim their plot. In Starkville, Mississippi, this pregame activity itself is a competition. Even as fans prepare to view a football contest later in the day, they will first compete for space where they can participate in the tailgating ritual. The “gaze” (Urry 2002) of the camera is focused on the fans’ anticipation, but it also shows the empty, coveted space. Why is this space so valuable? Perhaps because of the excellent proximity to the Davis Wade Stadium.
<br>
                But also the tradition itself serves to elevate the value of this space in the tailgaters’ minds. The tradition of rushing The Junction is part of gameday for Mississippi State fans, one that, as <a href="https://twitter.com/ToddBowering/status/1045780076145577984" target="_blank">a fellow fan noted in a direct reply tweet, never gets old.</a>  The rushing ritual along with other tailgating processes are themselves placemaking activities. Here, The Junction, formerly empty, grassy space, is made into a place infused with meaning by those who are lucky enough to stake their claim.

            8.	Several themes already explored appear in this tweet about the University of Tennessee: the tweeter and his wife (who is tagged in the tweet) are seen in their orange and smoky gray getup in preparation for the Vols’ season opener in 2018. Rather than a picture of the couple at an iconic pregame tradition in Knoxville like the Vol Navy or the band’s “playing to The Hill” performance outside Neyland Stadium, they are photographed in front of a backdrop of the Tennessee football team’s traditional entrance onto the field: running through the “T.”. The vantage point of the backdrop allows the couple to simulate actively participating inside this tradition that fans usually experience with a more passive voyeurism. It is unclear if this picture was taken on the day this tweet was sent, but if it was, it was shot in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Tennessee played in a neutral-site game. In this case, this backdrop serves as a way to infuse the very place-based gameday traditions of Knoxville, Tennessee, into the unclaimed no-man’s-land of Charlotte, North Carolina. <br>
Prominently making an appearance in this tweet is Smokey, Tennessee’s live blue tick hound mascot. Mascots are icons that are frequently included in the festival of gameday; several SEC schools have dog mascots, and LSU even has a live tiger, Mike. Mascots are revered by their fans even as they are misunderstood by outsiders (see Parks & Recreation‘s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUvkyBH--D0&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">satire</a> of this). Often, a team’s nickname and mascot are related (the Georgia Bulldogs’ mascot is an actual bulldog), but this is not always the case (The Alabama Crimson Tide’s mascot is an elephant). Mascots can be represented in artificial human costumes or by live animals. Regardless, they are not static sideline ornaments but can be very powerful icons evocative of a school’s history or its fans’ collective memory. Some mascots can be extremely controversial (Bever 2011), but they can also inspire a great deal of pride. Smokey is seen in this tweet as an icon of Tennessee football, and the tweeter and his wife’s proximity to the hound serves to elevate their fandom in the eyes of his followers.

            The initial connector to neighboring Wabush was built as Route 503 on the eastern edge of the town plat with an industrial district for the QNS&L railway and IOC headquarters of the Carol Lake Project.

            With the opening of the Mont Wright mine and the establishment of Fermont across the Labrador border in Quebec in 1973, an interregional road network was extended west as the Trans-Labrador Highway (Route 500) in a beltway loop around the north side of Labrador City, and in 1992 extended east to Goose Bay (Brown 2018). The Quebec link to Mont Wright and south to Fire Lake and Gagnon along the Cartier Railway was opened in 1986 as Route 389, unpaved, but connected to the Daniel Johnson hydroelectric dam at Manic-Cinq and paved south to Baie Comeau on the St. Lawrence River. Route 389 thus provides a vital overland highway connection between Quebec Province and Labrador City. Once established, Route 500 became the locational axis for the expansion of retail and institutional sites, including the Gateway Centre tourist office. The most important was the building of the Labrador Mall in 1978 with a Hudson Bay Company store (now Walmart), Canadian Tire, and a Tim Horton’s restaurant (Dupré 2018). More recently the Labrador West campus of the College of the North Atlantic in 2011 and the new Labrador West Health Centre (Compass 2017) have built large complexes along the highway.

            With the long winter season from September to June, the primary recreational activities in Labrador City are snow sports. A well-developed ski resort is located at Smokey Mountain near the Carol Lakes mines north of town. A variety of off-track road trails parallel the major highways and extend beyond Labrador City to Goose Bay by the White Wolf Snowmobile Club along Route 500 (www.white-wolf.net 2018). For the short summer months of July and August the Tamarack Golf Club is located off Route 500 at Long Lake and a recreational vehicle camp has been established at nearly Duley Lake some 7 miles (10km) west on Route 500 from Labrador City. There is also an Interfaith Cemetery located off the highway (Brown 2018). Within the town, summer recreation is provided at Tanya Lake with a swimming beach and youth activities (Town of Labrador City 2018). <br><br>

            The metropolitan complex of Labrador City, with adjacent Wabush and Fermont, Quebec has fluctuated in population with the economic success of the adjacent iron mining operations, from a maximum of some 22,000 in the 1970s to its present size of about 12,000 (Wikipedia “Labrador City” 2018). The urban area is unique for its divided cultural identity, the Labrador West portion speaking English within the greater province of Newfoundland, while the Quebec portion speaks French in Fermont, and the mining operations at Mont Wright and Lac Bloom. In addition, the area is divided by time zones, with Labrador City and Wabush in Atlantic Time (with Nova Scotia) and Quebec Province in Eastern Standard Time with Montreal. Thus, crossing the Labrador-Quebec border on Route 500/389 involves a change of hours and shift of languages within a short distance.  (<a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>) In addition to the English/French cultural division, there has been a recent influx of Filipino migration in the service sector of franchise restaurants and motels that matches with the existing Catholic population (Shaw 2018). There is also a presence of strip bars and nightclubs that serve the predominantly male culture of the transient mining operations (Wikipedia “Fermont” 2018).

            <h3>Future Prospect</h3>
            <p>

            Future development of the Labrador City metropolitan area is dependent on continued expansion of mining operations in the Labrador Trough. The fluctuations of iron ore prices on the world market has both closed and opened new iron ore sites both in Labrador and Quebec. At present three active open pit mines are in operation: Carol Lake by Rito Tinto adjacent to Labrador City; Mont Wright by ArcelorMittal near Fermont, Quebec; and Lac Bloom, Quebec by Champion Iron Ltd., also near Fermont. Though quite distant from Labrador City, operations at Shefferville, Quebec have also been reopened in recent years, and there is speculation that the mine at Fire Lake, Quebec might also be reactivated in the near future (Jamasmie 2014). Thus, the prospect for continued economic viability of the Labrador City area remains positive for the near future as the opening of the Labrador West Medical Centre and College of the North Atlantic indicates. Moreover the expansion of the regional highway network, the paving of the Trans-Labrador Highway-Route 500, east to Goose Bay and the coast of Labrador, and the improvement of Quebec Route 389 south to Baie Comeau and Quebec City, will certainly ensure greater integration into the Canadian economy, keeping the Labrador City area viable as the economic and cultural core of western Labrador and northern Quebec.
