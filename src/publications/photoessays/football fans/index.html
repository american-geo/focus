            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>College football is a United States phenomenon that occurs every autumn. Much of the attention given to the sport is usually directed towards the competitive game itself. Entire media apparatuses exist to predict and retrospectively analyze the outcomes of college football games. However, this is to serve fanbases across the country that invest in following their football team throughout the course of a season. Popular support for college football teams is visible in American culture through inscriptions in the landscape, consumptive economic activities, and altered mobility dynamics in host cities and towns on gamedays. A heightened affinity exists for the following of college football in the southern United States, and football contributes greatly to the cultural geography of many areas in the US South (Morgan & Klimasewski 2015). For many regional residents, their support for their favorite college football team, especially those members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), helps them to define and construct a place identity. <br>
            The academic study of sport within and outside the discipline of geography has traditionally focused on player production origins and the marketing and management of mega sports events (Wise & Kohe 2020, see Rooney 1969, Hetherington 1993, Lee et al. 2011, Menaker & Chaney 2014). However, there is a need to further examine vernacular, grassroots sports fandom and the ways in which support of sports teams impacts landscapes, identities, lifestyles, the environment, and human dynamics. While focusing on more popular actors like players, coaches, or managerial staff within various sports apparatuses is useful for garnering a greater understanding of competitive and recreational cultures and geographies, everyday fans deserve attention for the roles they play in the economic and cultural development of sport and tourism within society. This is especially true in 2020, a year in which the COVID-19 pandemic has immensely changed the way in which teams’ supporters perform their fandom (Majumdar & Naha 2020). Particularly, it has impeded fans’ ability to attend these games in-person, resulting in a loss of a cherished ritual for many (Cooper & Alderman 2020). <br>
            A widespread tool of fandom available to many of these common fans is social media. Fandoms and fanbases are constructed as imagined communities that support themselves by continued affirmation and recreation (Anderson 2016, Hills 2002).  Social media and its platforms have proven to be a useful apparatus for fanbases seeking to do this because it instantly connects groups with common interests across any distance to show a collective simultaneous attention to an event or matter (Dillette et al. 2019). These platforms have proven to be a powerful social force in the United States for not only revolutionizing the construction of sports fandom and fan communities; it is also changing the very places in which the sport is played. Because of the power of SEC football fandom in the U.S. South, member schools’ coaches and players are afforded a celebrity social status. Using this status and the social media platform Twitter, Mississippi State running back Kylin Hill <a href="https://twitter.com/H_Kylin/status/1275128689638936581" target="_blank">advocated</a>  for the changing of the state’s flag amid the United States’ period of intense racial reckoning in 2020.  After decades of advocacy for the replacement of this emblem which bared the racist yet controversial southern Confederate battle flag (Webster & Leib 2016, Brasher 2019), Hill’s one tweet led to immediate action by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/1e1d9c2726493917790a122b3e539355" target="_blank">SEC</a> and National Collegiate Athletic Association <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bc2347ed8a69f52bc7b060b30661808c" target="_blank">(NCAA)</a> that pushed the State of Mississippi to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/politics/mississippi-confederate-flag-vote/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twcnnbrk&utm_term=image&utm_content=2020-06-27T20%3A14%3A46" target="_blank">formally change </a> its flag. Through both the creation of fan communities and the very making of place, social media is a social force. <br>
                Social media platforms like Twitter are also useful in conducting geographic research because the media itself is generated in spaces and places that give insight into how, where, and when people (re)create places (Poorthuis et al. 2016, Metzger et al. 2016, Arthur & Williams 2019). Game days are particularly good times to study these fan cultures because of fans’ observance of pregame and game-time rituals. Rituals should not be misconstrued as banal, mundane activities; rather, ritual can give meaningful insight into societies, cultures, and communities (Turner 1969, Geertz 1972).<br>
                This project therefore uses Twitter to examine the dynamics of college football fandom in the pre-COVID era on game days in the US South in relation to fans’ place identity and construction of a community of fandom. Only tweets from public accounts were used. To search for relevant tweets, “vaguely purposive” (Reed 1976, 926) keywords like “game day” and “tailgate” were used in conjunction with official and unofficial team hashtags (Notes 1 & 2). Hashtags succinctly group tweets and their text, pictures, or videos to a single topic on Twitter, and these hashtags can be used to foster virtual community construction (Dillette et al. 2019). This essay employs a twist on volunteer employed photography, a research method that is valuable in studying sport and its actors’ relationship to place and space (Hinch & Kono 2018). These photos were volunteered on public accounts into the public domain of Twitter. Social media photos are particularly useful in photography analyses because text usually accompanies the pictures that can complement, explain, and in some ways complicate the image or the user’s intent in posting it. <br>
                This essay is focused on bottom-up fandom, so while most of the pictures returned by the query that was used to search Twitter (Notes) were generated by the official football accounts of the SEC schools, only photos posted by other non-affiliated users were employed here. Additionally, when a Twitter account was a personal one (neither a fan nor a verified account), no ancillary information about the user was gleaned or used. If the user was verified as a public figure, further exploration of their profiles occasionally contributed to the discussion. <br>
                
                Considering the power of the internet and social media to allow users to express both fandom and place-based identity, this piece works to investigate and contextualize the various ways in which Twitter users express Southeastern Conference football fandom through photos. The analysis will seek to qualitatively explore different ways in which imagined communities and places within the US South are constructed and created through experiences of college football fandom.

            <br>
            <p>1.SEC football fandom is not reserved exclusively for the fall. After the triumphs or defeats of the previous autumn, fans often follow their teams during the off-season through recruiting in the spring and practice in the summer in anticipation of the next upcoming season. Noted sports geographer John Bale includes anticipation as a vital part of the sports spectator’s experience (2003, 120). Football is one of the shorter seasons in college sports, and if the sport is an important component of one’s collective regional identity, that fan will attempt to stay connected to the sport outside of the autumn season. A considerable number of hours on ESPN’s SEC television network is devoted to covering the 14 teams’ off-season activities because there is a market for this coverage due to this anticipation. Social media serves as a year-round platform where fans can continually engage with their collective support. This fan’s tweet shows an empty Ben Hill Griffin Stadium with a countdown until gameday. There is a potential energy communicated in this visual: the stadium is not yet full of its thousands of fans, the field is not yet primed and painted for the action, and the athletes are nowhere to be seen. And yet, there is an excitement and longing for the eventual time when the pageantry of gameday is realized and the ritual is rejuvenated.

            <p>2.After anticipating the journey, the next steps in Bale’s (2003) spectator’s experience sequentially include the journey to spectate and then the on-site stadium experience itself. In theorizing specifically the spectator experience of American college football, it would be useful to add another step in between the journey and the game: tailgating. Fans of the SEC tend to take their tailgating very seriously. <i>Southern Living,</i> a magazine that serves as a guide for how a perceived “good Southerner” lives in the exceptional South (Lauder 2012), has published two editions of the SEC tailgating cookbook to capitalize upon the fact that this particular ritual is a vital part of gameday for many ticket holders. This tweet from 2007 was sent at 9:15 AM showing off a fully set-up tailgating scene in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The sender contently declares his/er place to be superior to all others because of the food, event, and stadium view. Cooking food is a very common component of tailgating, and this fan is showing that s/he is so committed that they began cooking early in the morning for what was that day a 7:00 PM game. In the background is Tiger Stadium where the tailgater’s LSU team would play later that day. Again, we see the stadium as a significant icon for fans as they express their fandom. Participation in the tailgating ritual on a gameday in proximity to this cathedral creates for this tweeter the ideal place and experience.</p>

              <h3>Planning the Mining Communities</h3>

            <p>Once established in 1950, the IOC surveyed other tracts in the Labrador Trough some 257 miles (441km) north of Sépt-Iles. Among the most promising was the Wabush and Carol Lake areas, some 36 miles (58km) west of the QNS&L railway, named Labrador West (L’Ouest du Labrador), the eventual site of Labrador City. (https://labradorwest.com. 2018). The connecting Wabush Railway was opened in 1960 with two town sites, at Wabush and Carol Lake, renamed Labrador City by Newfoundland Premier Minister Joseph Smallwood in June 1961 (Geren and McCullough 1990). The City town site was carefully planned by the Ottawa firm of Dineen, with curvilinear streets, beside Little Wabush Lake, preserving tracts of taiga woodland between street blocks. The IOC managed the housing sales and mortgage rates and established a town council in 1964. As part of attracting settlers, they opened schools overseen by Newfoundland administrators by 1960; a hospital; and a Roman Catholic parish in 1962, along with Anglican and Protestant congregations.

            <p>The neighboring town of Wabush was established in 1962 with a regional airport and a community plan on a sloping hillside by the planning firm from the Montreal Expo in 1967 (Geren and McCullough 1990).    </p>

                 <p>At the same time that Labrador City was constructed, a second mining complex was located in Quebec at the southern end of the Trough at Lac Jeannine with the newly planned town of Gagnon under the auspices of The Quebec Mining Company (QMC) financed by U.S. Steel and Canadian investors. A special mining railroad, Chemin de Fer du Cartier (CFC), was built in 1960, 190 miles (306km) north from Shelter Bay, renamed Port Cartier, on the St. Lawrence River with the first iron ore shipped in 1961 (Wikipedia “Railways in Labrador” 2017). Like Labrador City, Gagnon was planned with schools, a hospital and churches. It reached a population of some 4,000 by the early 1970s as a French speaking settlement (Wikipedia “Gagnon, Quebec” 2018). However, like Shefferville to the north, the mining ore was exhausted by the late 1970s and the town of Gagnon Ville was completely dismantled in 1985. Instead, the QMC opened a new iron mine at Mont Wright and in 1972 the CFC extended its rail line 86 miles (138km) north, with the new town of Fermont (Iron Mountain) in 1974 some 15 miles (23km) from Labrador City. As with Gagnon, Fermont was settled as a French-speaking community with the town designed after the Swedish mining center of Svappavaara in modern concrete style (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>) (Wikipedia “Fermont” 2018). </p>

            <p>
            Further development of the Labrador Trough occurred in 1981 with the open pit mine at Fire Lake, north of Gagnon, on the Cartier Railway (Wikipedia “Fire Lake” 2018). At Labrador City an expansion of the Carol Lake mine by the IOC continued through the 1990s with the construction of the Carol Lake Railway, an automated electric line some 8 miles (13km) north of the original site. It is now owned by Rio Tinto, an Australian mining company (Wikipedia “Carol Lake” 2018). Recently, the most extensive mining development has been located at Lac Bloom (Bloom Lake) near the Mont Wright complex in 2006. A new railroad extension of the Wabush Railway was opened in 2010, 22 miles (36km) west of Labrador City across the border in Quebec by Quebec Iron Ore, Inc. (<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>)

            It was recently purchased by Champion Iron Limited (Iron Ore: Bloom Lake. 2018). Also of recent development is the reopening of mining operations at Shefferville with several new sites, although the town remains a skeleton of the original plan. To accommodate the First Nations native population, the QNS&L established a passenger operation in 2005 under the name of Tshiuetin Rail Transportation with direct service to Sépt-Iles (Wikipedia “Railways in Labrador” 2018).

            Despite the ups and downs of iron mining, Labrador City looks much as it did right after its initial founding in 1961. The civic center is located within the eastern plan of the site along Hudson Drive with the Town Office, Central Fire Station, Public Library and Labrador West Arts Center, all in single story buildings, with the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on the crest of the hill. The original residential district surrounding the civic center remains stylistically intact with single story American type ranch houses on suburban lots. (<a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>)

            The original retail district was developed along Avalon Drive with the Carol Lake Shopping Center, a two-story brick complex of professional offices and stores. Beyond this central axis, the outer residential district was developed with two story row houses down to Tamarack Drive along Little Wabush Lake (Town of Labrador City Street Map 2018). In the far western district, a street grid was developed for mobile homes along Bartlett Drive as the Harris Lake trailer park. (<a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>)

            The initial connector to neighboring Wabush was built as Route 503 on the eastern edge of the town plat with an industrial district for the QNS&L railway and IOC headquarters of the Carol Lake Project. The Route 503 bypass developed as a retail strip along Avalon Drive with franchise restaurants such as McDonald’s, various motels, gas stations and auto dealerships.
            (<a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a>)  The main Jackman Memorial Hospital, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, and the Labrador City Arena (Hockey and Curling) were all set on the eastern edge of Booth Avenue with access to Route 503.

            With the opening of the Mont Wright mine and the establishment of Fermont across the Labrador border in Quebec in 1973, an interregional road network was extended west as the Trans-Labrador Highway (Route 500) in a beltway loop around the north side of Labrador City, and in 1992 extended east to Goose Bay (Brown 2018). The Quebec link to Mont Wright and south to Fire Lake and Gagnon along the Cartier Railway was opened in 1986 as Route 389, unpaved, but connected to the Daniel Johnson hydroelectric dam at Manic-Cinq and paved south to Baie Comeau on the St. Lawrence River. Route 389 thus provides a vital overland highway connection between Quebec Province and Labrador City. Once established, Route 500 became the locational axis for the expansion of retail and institutional sites, including the Gateway Centre tourist office. The most important was the building of the Labrador Mall in 1978 with a Hudson Bay Company store (now Walmart), Canadian Tire, and a Tim Horton’s restaurant (Dupré 2018). More recently the Labrador West campus of the College of the North Atlantic in 2011 and the new Labrador West Health Centre (Compass 2017) have built large complexes along the highway.

            With the long winter season from September to June, the primary recreational activities in Labrador City are snow sports. A well-developed ski resort is located at Smokey Mountain near the Carol Lakes mines north of town. A variety of off-track road trails parallel the major highways and extend beyond Labrador City to Goose Bay by the White Wolf Snowmobile Club along Route 500 (www.white-wolf.net 2018). For the short summer months of July and August the Tamarack Golf Club is located off Route 500 at Long Lake and a recreational vehicle camp has been established at nearly Duley Lake some 7 miles (10km) west on Route 500 from Labrador City. There is also an Interfaith Cemetery located off the highway (Brown 2018). Within the town, summer recreation is provided at Tanya Lake with a swimming beach and youth activities (Town of Labrador City 2018). <br><br>

            The metropolitan complex of Labrador City, with adjacent Wabush and Fermont, Quebec has fluctuated in population with the economic success of the adjacent iron mining operations, from a maximum of some 22,000 in the 1970s to its present size of about 12,000 (Wikipedia “Labrador City” 2018). The urban area is unique for its divided cultural identity, the Labrador West portion speaking English within the greater province of Newfoundland, while the Quebec portion speaks French in Fermont, and the mining operations at Mont Wright and Lac Bloom. In addition, the area is divided by time zones, with Labrador City and Wabush in Atlantic Time (with Nova Scotia) and Quebec Province in Eastern Standard Time with Montreal. Thus, crossing the Labrador-Quebec border on Route 500/389 involves a change of hours and shift of languages within a short distance.  (<a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>) In addition to the English/French cultural division, there has been a recent influx of Filipino migration in the service sector of franchise restaurants and motels that matches with the existing Catholic population (Shaw 2018). There is also a presence of strip bars and nightclubs that serve the predominantly male culture of the transient mining operations (Wikipedia “Fermont” 2018).

            <h3>Future Prospect</h3>
            <p>

            Future development of the Labrador City metropolitan area is dependent on continued expansion of mining operations in the Labrador Trough. The fluctuations of iron ore prices on the world market has both closed and opened new iron ore sites both in Labrador and Quebec. At present three active open pit mines are in operation: Carol Lake by Rito Tinto adjacent to Labrador City; Mont Wright by ArcelorMittal near Fermont, Quebec; and Lac Bloom, Quebec by Champion Iron Ltd., also near Fermont. Though quite distant from Labrador City, operations at Shefferville, Quebec have also been reopened in recent years, and there is speculation that the mine at Fire Lake, Quebec might also be reactivated in the near future (Jamasmie 2014). Thus, the prospect for continued economic viability of the Labrador City area remains positive for the near future as the opening of the Labrador West Medical Centre and College of the North Atlantic indicates. Moreover the expansion of the regional highway network, the paving of the Trans-Labrador Highway-Route 500, east to Goose Bay and the coast of Labrador, and the improvement of Quebec Route 389 south to Baie Comeau and Quebec City, will certainly ensure greater integration into the Canadian economy, keeping the Labrador City area viable as the economic and cultural core of western Labrador and northern Quebec.
