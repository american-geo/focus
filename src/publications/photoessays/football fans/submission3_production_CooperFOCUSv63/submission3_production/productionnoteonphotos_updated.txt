The first photo of the essay has since ben taken down from twitter. 
It is attached separately, but all original pictures can be found in the word .docx.

I have submitted an updated clean version of the article as both a .pdf and .docx now
to reflect a few minor bibliographical and acknowledgement changes. Please use the 
"foucs_cleanversion_cooper2020_submit3_productionedits" version.

I would like to discuss best practices for how to include the tweets interactively
but in ways that will preserve the photographic content that does not rely on 
the preservation of the tweets on Twitter's end.

Many thanks,
J. A. Cooper
